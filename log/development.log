Where is the outrage for the hundreds of young black males being incarcerated? Or the disgrace concerning black on black crime? Where are the voices calling for school choice in public education? And where are those who are truly concerned about issues such as economic empowerment? Dr. Ben Carson and Gov. Mike Huckabee, and various Pro-life, Pro-family leaders, will discuss how the conservative message not only has the power to change, but to transform lives. This conference is not limited to black pro-lifers, but to everyone who believes that &quot;all lives matter, &quot; and that advocacy of life affirming public policy has limitless possibilities for elevating everyone&#39;s standard of life.

Jung San is known for his meticulous  and complex works,  which he infuses with his Buddhist ideas. His work often contains unconventional materials, such as razorblades, nail polish, and matchboxes. These innovative pieces leave viewers in both deep contemplation and wonder.<br><br>This May, Jung San returns with the second part of his &#39;Beyond Words Series&#39;, which  illustrates his development as an artist. For this show, Jung San wrote countless stories in calligraphy on handmade paper, which were then folded and combined  to form several pieces of art.  For Jung San, the &#39;Beyond Words Series&#39;  reflect his belief that even when words are obscured or silenced, they still have  meaning. Jung San&#39;s new works convey these ideas through their freeform exuberance, which contrasts well with the clean lines that defined Part 1 of the &#39;Beyond Words Series.&#39; Please join us May 7th from 5:30-7:30 pm at the show opening to celebrate the return of this phenomenal artist. <p>\n\nMORE INFO: <br>Website: <a href=\"http://sandraleegallery.com/upcoming-exhibitions/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sandraleegallery.com/upcoming-exhibitions/</a> <br>Email:   <a href=\"mailto:art@sandraleegallery.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">art@sandraleegallery.com</a> <br>Phone:   415-291-8000 \n\nSubmitted by the <a href=\"http://www.fullcalendar.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>FullCalendar Event Promotion Service</strong></a></p>"], ["end_time", "2015-05-07"], ["free", "f"], ["name", "Jung San: Understanding Beyond Words Part 2"], ["performer", ""], ["start_time", "2015-05-07"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-20 18:44:42.851158"], ["venue", "Sandra Lee Gallery"]]

Sway to the tunes of award-winning guitarist and composer Kenya Baker. All the while, enjoy the indisputable wines of summer—our crisp Sauvignon Blanc and rose-hued Rosé of Syrah.. JUNE 19 SAM&#39;S CHOWDERMOBILE & CROWDING OUT East meets west with the delectable lobster rolls and clam chowder of Sam’s Chowderhouse.

JUNE 26 SLIDER SHACK & HIWATTERS Come and get your sliders with a Hawaiian twist courtesy of Slider Shack where “the fun’s between the buns.” The perfect musical interlude will be provided by the surf tunes of the Hiwatters.

At the heart of small business marketing are the campaigns that drive action – collections of marketing activities that help a small business or organization to achieve its goals and objectives. Newsletters and Announcements have become a core component of those campaign choices. Email is more important than ever – to the communication efforts of businesses and nonprofits everywhere; and to the customer, donor, client or supporter of those organizations.    This session will reveal some simple but effective best practices and considerations for the small business or nonprofit seeking to make their email newsletters more effective. Attendees of this presentation will learn:   • Campaigns in general: what is a campaign, types of newsletters  • What to write about in your newsletter or announcement and how to consider using images  • Subject line best practices, and when to send your newsletter  • The importance of understanding how connected email and social media are…they have to be done together.  • What types of additional tools might be useful Join us and learn some great new strategies to help your email and social media efforts be more effective components of one of the core campaign types, newsletters and announcements.   Topic 2:  Subject Line Tips to Get Your Emails Opened. The Subject Line will make or break your email efforts.  We will review best practices and tips for subject lines so that YOUR emails never get deleted    Bonus: Email critique. Send us a copy of your newsletter to etager@constantcontact.com with the subject line “CRITIQUE”  and we can analyze and offer suggestions in class.    Pre-registration is required. The preferred form of payment is online via Eventbrite.  However, if this is not possible, then a check or money order will be accepted.  If the payment is made in cash, it will have to be exact since the SCORE office does not have access to change.  If change is needed then the attendee will have to get the change needed at one on the retail stores on the first floor so the exact amount can be paid.   "], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s1.evcdn.com/store/skin/no_image/categories/128x128/other.jpg"], ["name", "Combine Email and Social Media to Make Money"], ["performer", ""], ["start_time", "2015-06-19"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-20 18:44:50.478188"], ["venue", "SBA offices"]]

Spirit of Youth Yoga: A Social Enterprise to Empower Youth YWSE-SF is proud to host an incredible social entrepreneur for our July gathering. Spirit of Youth Yoga is an inspiring company born out of desire to empower youth. After founder Pam Lozoff shares the story of her company, we will jump in as a community to help Pam with her business development including marketing, growth and client focus. Your expertise is needed and we hope to see you there! About Pam and Spirit of Youth Yoga:  Pam Lozoff is a social worker and a yoga instructor with a background in youth development and a passion for a &quot;whole-person&quot; and trauma-informed approaches to working with underrepresented young people. After completing her MSW at Columbia University with an emphasis in social enterprise administration, she had become disillusioned with the status quo social service agencies that were reducing people to numbers, working to help them survive, rather than thrive. She knew she wanted to marry her passions together and start something, in fact, she knew she couldn&#39;t NOT take this leap of faith and create something.  Founded in 2014, Spirit of Youth Yoga was born out of Pam&#39;s own healing journey through yoga and experiences working with young people. Its mission is to empower underrepresented young people to transform their inner strengths into community strengths through yoga and peer education. They partner with youth service agencies throughout the Bay Area to deliver their 16-week personal and professional development curriculum and then train youth to become paid facilitators of the curriculum with their peers. They are also beginning to offer Changemaker Support programs, which are trainings in self-care, self-regulation, and emotional intelligence for the people who serve young people. The long term vision is to create a holistic center which will employ young people who have gone through the program, as yoga instructors, facilitators, administrative staff, PR representatives, or whatever most suits their unique strengths. Join the movement toward wholeness at Spirit of Youth Yoga!   About YWSE-SF Monthly Community Gatherings YWSE-San Francisco partners with The Women&#39;s Building to host monthly community events! When: First Tuesday of every month, 6:30pm - 8:30pm (Note the new time!)  Have you wondered what it actually means to be an entrepreneur? We are all about creating a space to launch women to develop their dreams, (may that be businesses, projects, or careers). You don&#39;t have to be an &quot;entrepreneur&quot; or &quot;young&quot; to be part of YWSE. If you are passionate about changing the world and connecting with an inspiring group of movers and shakers, then this community is for you!  The gatherings always include networking time (casual or facilitated) and feature a different topic, exercise, speaker, or workshop as the main event. Light snacks and wine are served. Join us! Questions?

Tara will outline the approach Cozi uses to optimize important flows and touchpoints using Mixpanel and provide examples of tangible improvements to user experience across mobile, web, and email.

The winning team will be whisked away for an exclusive meeting with Senator Paul to show him what they’ve created.  The top two teams will get autographed constitutions (as seen here).  Your work can help give our technology community a voice on the issues about which you care the most. As a team of one to four people, you will work on a project that furthers Rand Paul’s mission of protecting our privacy and liberty. You will have 24 hours to complete this project. These 24 hours include the time to create all materials needed for your presentation. Please do not start the project before the hackathon. However, we encourage you to think of ideas before coming to the hackathon. At the end of the 24th hour, you will have a short period of time to present your project.  Winners will be judged based on innovation, novelty, and practicality. We hope to see you there!

The three-day event runs Friday - Sunday, April 10-12 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day on West Portal Avenue between 15th and Ulloa.<br><br>Local residents and tourists alike flock to admire the works of more than 40 artists displaying everything from photography, paintings, ceramics, jewelry and much more. The show is free to the public and is presented by the West Portal Avenue Association. Among the featured artists at this year&#39;s show:<br><br>Jennifer Clifford<br>Studio: San Francisco <br>Medium: Mixed Media<br>Art: Drawing inspiration from the beautiful San Francisco Bay, Jennifer creates whimsical collage and screen print art.<br>Creative Process: Jennifer&#39;s collage work incorporates media from variety of paper materials, including wallpaper, old ticket stubs, Muni and BART passes, maps, newsprint, rice paper, and vintage magazines. Vibrant offbeat fabrics are also found in her collages, some of which are repurposed clothes. Her screen print work is created from her photography. She prints on fabric and/or wallpaper and mounts each print to a wood panel. She describes her approach to design as textural, colorful, resourceful, imperfect, and eclectic.<br><br>John Osterhaug<br>Studio: San Francisco <br>Medium: Glass<br>Art: Jewelry<br>Creative Process: Since the 1980s, John has made glass jewelry, including cufflinks for men, by creating bright and reflective, almost neon color on fused glass with oxidizing metals, which he kiln fires. John creates all of his work from start to finish. He begins the process by cutting, sanding, drilling and kiln-firing multi-colored pieces of glass and then crafts them into earrings, pendants, rings, necklaces and bracelets. &quot;The method that I use to create my jewelry results in a unique set of work exhibiting a luminescent quality that glistens and glows as you move it,&quot; said John.<br><br>Locke Heemstra<br>Studio: San Mateo<br>Medium: Giclée photographic prints, which are individually produced, high-resolution prints made using a sophisticated wide format inkjet printer technology. <br>Art: Locke&#39;s photographic images are printed on large canvas, then cut to size and stretched over 1-1/4&quot; stretcher bars. The 1-1/4 inch edges of the photographic canvases have a unique artistic appearance as the image continues to fold around the sides to the back, eliminating the need for frames or glass.<br>Creative Process: Locke&#39;s early images focused on the natural wonders of the United States, from the rich fall foliage of New England to the vivid blues and greens of the California coast. In time, he began to concentrate on natural and manmade settings lush with color. The public&#39;s enthusiastic response to the vibrant colors in his work convinced Locke he was on the right path. Next, he decided to combine his love of European culture with his new approach to color. Today, Locke travels to Europe at least three times a year, always searching for that special image that will give the viewer a sense of place. <br><br>For more information about the West Portal Avenue Sidewalk Arts and Crafts Fair contact the West Portal Avenue Association at (415) 566-3500 or Pacific Fine Arts Festivals at (209) 267-4394 or visit <a href=\"http://www.pacificfinearts.com/\" rel=\"nowfollow\" rel=\"nowfollow\" rel=\"nowfollow\">http://www.pacificfinearts.com</a> on Facebook at <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/PacificFineArts\" rel=\"nowfollow\" rel=\"nowfollow\" rel=\"nowfollow\">http://www.facebook.com/PacificFineArts</a> and Twitter @PacificFineArts"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s1.evcdn.com/store/skin/no_image/categories/128x128/other.jpg"], ["name", "West Portal Sidewalk Fine Arts & Crafts Fair"], ["performer", ""], ["start_time", "2015-04-11"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-20 18:45:22.267707"], ["venue", "West Portal Ave Association"]]

With Robin on fiddle, mandolin, and guitar, Libby on piano and accordion, and both of them sharing vocals, this polished and passionate duo creates their own marvelous blend of roots music—they call it Celtic Americana—grounded in tradition but with a sound that’s always fresh and contemporary. “With wit, searing virtuosity, and warm humanity,” says the website <i>Indie-Music.com</i>, Robin and Libby make music that is “moving, fun, and dazzlingly imaginative.” Their new album, <i>One Plus One</i>, features just the two of them, on songs powerful, delightful, and sublime. Tonight they’ll be joined by a choice group of musicians, including Danny Carnahan of Wake the Dead on fiddle, guitar, and vocals, Jan Martinelli of Wild Mango on bass, and special guests.<br><br>Their musical partnership, which Ronnie Gilbert called “a musical marriage made in heaven,” has flourished for more than two decades. Robin has played in acoustic duos and trios with such musicians as Barbara Higbie, Nancy Vogl, and Laurie Lewis; toured with finger-picking legend Elizabeth Cotton, old-time music stars Hazel and Alice, and Holly Near; and recorded four albums as leader of the Robin Flower Band. Libby played in several bands before teaming up with Robin, including a long stint with the Roches. Together, the two have toured America and Canada, New Zealand and Ireland, and shared the stage with Pete Seeger, who afterwards sent them a note saying, “It was a real pleasure to hear you sing.

You swipe to open the app - five of the latest tweets from everybody in the coworking space: a few new articles they retweeted, an Instagram photo from Jessica’s last trip to Tahoe, news about the deal that Dave from upstairs just closed with his largest client since December #success.  Pumping personality into space is Murmur’s mission. To do it, co-founders Eugene Joseph and Adam Becker began by building an app that allows you to see the tweets of everybody within Bluetooth range. An entirely new way of keeping updated with what people around you are interested in and a new way to engage with them. Our short term goal is to cover up Berkeley with a large Bluetooth cloud, where people’s tweets are liberated and roam free, where specific content hovers around specific locations. We’re out to build three types of Bluetooth nests in Berkeley - places where you’re sure to find these murmurs: schools, stores and coworking spaces. All three have the right conditions: they are dense, stationary, and ripe with information. Coworking spaces like Sandbox Suites, we believe, are ideal environments for murmurs to thrive. Busy teams don’t often have the time to keep in touch with all of the other teams in the coworking space, but many of the teams already use Twitter - so all they have to do is plug into the Murmur app. On July 8th, we’ll be coming to present our product during the Lunch and Learn, talk about our development, and paint our vision for the role of Sandbox. Mark your calendars- you don’t want to miss this one.You can learn more about us at www.getonmurmur.com and download Murmur at apple.co/1EJm1V9.

With our high coach to camper ratio, we ensure that every player is directly supervised, every player will receive direct instruction, and every player will get the proper individual attention they need. Our philosophy at BBA is that every player can play high school baseball or beyond with the right attitude, right coaching, and right practice. Through a focus on fundamentals and highly competitive games and activities, we specialize in making our campers play better baseball. BBA camps focus on the key fundamentals of throwing, catching, pitching, hitting, bunting, baserunning, sliding, and fielding. We constantly stress a good attitude, sportsmanship, hustle, and hard work because those are lasting traits both on and off the field. We know that players who are better teammates and love to learn from their coaches will go further than those who don&#39;t. You can expect that your son will improve their skills while attending Bronco Baseball Academy. You can also expect that they will learn to compete harder, love the game more, be a better teammate, be more respectful to their coaches and learn to further honor the great game of baseball. At BBA we encourage every camper to become their own coach, to develop their leadership skills, to be a better friend and student, to be a healthier person, and to become a true student of the game. We provide rewards for watching college and pro baseball games in the evenings and reading the sports page in the mornings. We ask trivia about the history of the game and we want all players to end the week by agreeing with us that baseball is the greatest game on earth."], ["end_time", "2015-06-19"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s1.evcdn.com/store/skin/no_image/categories/128x128/other.jpg"], ["name", "Summer Camp #1 - Bronco Baseball Academy"], ["performer", ""], ["start_time", "2015-06-15"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-20 18:45:35.266482"], ["venue", "Foothill Middle School"]]

We begin with coffee, pastries and introductions. Then Steve or Jessica will demonstrate the art of wheel throwing. A quick demonstration on wedging clay followed by the steps of throwing a cylinder on the potter&#39;s wheel. Then each participant gets up to 5, 1-pound balls of clay to try their hand at the potter&#39;s wheel. At the end of the 2-hr session, you can stay for a few hours and continue to work on your own. You can keep your new works of art, just choose a glaze color and we will dry and trim your work, fire it, glaze it and re-fire it. When it&#39;s ready, Steve will notify you it is ready for pick-up. <br><br>Remember to wear some clothes you don&#39;t mind getting dirty, bring your creative spirit and get ready to play-in-clay. <br><br>About Steven<br>Steven completed a BA and an MFA at San Francisco State University. His ceramic sculpture can be found in many private and permanent collections including the de Young Museum, Ceramics Research Center, Mission Clay Products, Gladding McBean, Dolan Law Firm and Lincoln Public Library.

July 15, at Trek Winery, Novato.\n\nSponsored by the Women’s Collective of Marin, this high powered event should interest people nearing retirement as well as younger individuals attracted income oriented investments. \n\nPanelists will review opportunities available, current trends, relative risk of different types of opportunities, market outlook, how to research and do’s and don’ts.  Tax strategies will also be covered, as will short term rentals through platforms like Air B’n’B.  \n\nReal estate maintains its appeal for investors because of relatively low interest rates and many tax advantages this type of investing offers. Because properties are hard assets, many investors feel more secure when they are able to diversify into real estate holdings, to complement their stock, bond and fund investments.\n\nCost is $15 for early registrations, $20 at the door. Hors d’oeuvres are offered. There will be a no-host cash bar starting at 5:30 p.m.; presentation starts at 6 p.m.  Trek Winery is located on Machin Ave., Novato.

Our one-week camp will introduce students to the robot game portion of the 2014 FLL World Class Challenge.   Students will build and program LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robots. They will learn about mechanical and software design, loops, and conditional statements as well as enhance their problem solving and teamwork skills.   Please note: FLL World Class Challenge I camp is NOT a pre-requisite to the FLL World Class Challenge II. There is simply more material that we can cover in a single, one-week camp. Therefore, students can take either one or both of the camps.   Previous programming experience is helpful, but not required. STEAMKids will provide use of LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robots and any additional equipment. Students need to bring a desire to learn and have fun!   Targeted ages: 9 and up     ***   We&#39;ll send you an email with specific logistics information a few days prior to camp. Please note that we ask campers to bring a nut-free lunch and water bottle daily.

Depending on the product being developed, e.g., tablets and capsules vs. biotechnology products, as few as fifteen to twenty or as many as sixty raw materials need to be sourced before the process can be moved from initiation through completion. This highly interactive two day seminar on raw material requirements in a cGMP environment will: Consider Health Canada, FDA, USP and EP requirements. Examine a variety of the issues surrounding raw materials to include what materials should be tested and to what extent during Phase 1, 2, 3 and commercial production. Cover testing requirements during each phase and what may be optional (regulatory risk) until the product moves to its next phase. Determine what options exist - even within a Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing framework. Discuss compendial vs. non-compendial testing and how to respond when no method is available. Discuss how a 90 percent vs. a 90.0 percent minimum purity analysis can delay initiation of testing. Explore the number of lots required for testing before reduced testing might occur and why some companies don&#39;t accept this route. Review the use of individual samples vs. composite samples for testing. Explore ASQ testing to include how to choose attributes and sample size. The objective of this two day seminar is to explore raw materials and their requirements – issues and solutions. It will also explore how water impacts the final product since water is the single largest raw material that is used within most processes. Another objective is to assure that your organization is maintaining itself within a cGMP compliance framework. Case studies to include Warning Letters will be discussed to illustrate regulatory raw material issues.   Note: Use coupon code 232082 and get 10% off on registration.

We&#39;ll also have some of the most interesting speakers from QS Show&Tell Meetups around the word reprise or update their talks for all of us, along with plenary session discussions of current topics in the technology and culture of self-tracking.   This will be a special year. Along with our two full days of working sessions, talks, office hours, and face-to-face collaboration, we are adding a third day for a grand public exposition in San Francisco’s most beautiful waterfront festival pavilion, where toolmakers, artists, designers, and pioneering self-trackers will be sharing their amazing work with the general public. On Saturday, June 20, at Herbst Pavilion, we are bringing together the most amazing self-tracking tools, so that we can all try them first hand and discuss them directly with their makers and developers.   If you are an advanced user, designer, inventor, entrepreneur, journalist, scientist, or health professional, please join us at the beautiful Fort Mason Center in San Francisco for three full days of inspirtation and collaboration.

If you do not feel stifled, we offer community engagement and gratitude. Our activities are highly participatory, but accessible and gentle enough to allow for a sense of safety and support. All the workshop activities are based off of the words of a wise visionary named Glenn Robinson--an incarcerated man serving a 40 year sentence in Angie, LA. Sample Activity: Each participant gets a piece of paper. On that paper they write out 5 ways in which they portray themselves to the world that might not be entirely accurate. We then put the papers in a pile, shuffle up, hand them back out (randomly) and read them anonymously. It&#39;s amazing to see the prisons we create for ourselves based on fear of how we will be perceived. **All proceeds will go towards covering the cost of the event, and towards further development of Beyond This Prison as an organization**   YouTube Video:  "], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s3.evcdn.com/images/block250/I0-001/019/894/170-0.jpeg_/beyond-prison-unshackling-70.jpeg"], ["name", "Beyond This Prison: UnShackling"], ["performer", ""], ["start_time", "2015-06-20"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-20 18:46:20.494500"], ["venue", "The Berkeley School"]]

Jung San is known for his meticulous  and complex works,  which he infuses with his Buddhist ideas. His work often contains unconventional materials, such as razorblades, nail polish, and matchboxes. These innovative pieces leave viewers in both deep contemplation and wonder.<br><br>This May, Jung San returns with the second part of his &#39;Beyond Words Series&#39;, which  illustrates his development as an artist. For this show, Jung San wrote countless stories in calligraphy on handmade paper, which were then folded and combined  to form several pieces of art.  For Jung San, the &#39;Beyond Words Series&#39;  reflect his belief that even when words are obscured or silenced, they still have  meaning. Jung San&#39;s new works convey these ideas through their freeform exuberance, which contrasts well with the clean lines that defined Part 1 of the &#39;Beyond Words Series.&#39; Please join us May 7th from 5:30-7:30 pm at the show opening to celebrate the return of this phenomenal artist. <p>\n\nMORE INFO: <br>Website: <a href=\"http://sandraleegallery.com/upcoming-exhibitions/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sandraleegallery.com/upcoming-exhibitions/</a> <br>Email:   <a href=\"mailto:art@sandraleegallery.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">art@sandraleegallery.com</a> <br>Phone:   415-291-8000 \n\nSubmitted by the <a href=\"http://www.fullcalendar.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>FullCalendar Event Promotion Service</strong></a></p>"], ["end_time", "2015-05-07"], ["free", "f"], ["name", "Jung San: Understanding Beyond Words Part 2"], ["start_time", "2015-05-07"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-21 16:59:48.958148"], ["venue", "Sandra Lee Gallery"]]

Then each participant gets up to 5, 1-pound balls of clay to try their hand at the potter&#39;s wheel. At the end of the 2-hr session, you can stay for a few hours and continue to work on your own. You can keep your new works of art, just choose a glaze color and we will dry and trim your work, fire it, glaze it and re-fire it. When it&#39;s ready, Steve will notify you it is ready for pick-up. <br><br>Remember to wear some clothes you don&#39;t mind getting dirty, bring your creative spirit and get ready to play-in-clay. <br><br>About Steven<br>Steven completed a BA and an MFA at San Francisco State University.

In 2010, Desaparecidos played together again at the Concert for Equality in Omaha (an event organized by Oberst to promote the repeal of then-recently enacted measures to prohibit businesses and landlords from hiring or renting to undocumented immigrants in Fremont, Nebraska). The band embarked on a short summer tour in 2012, and self-released several tracks on singles and 7-inches for the next year. Previously released tracks that are featured on the album are &quot;MariKKKopa&quot;, &quot;Backsell&quot;, &quot;Anonymous&quot;, &quot;The Left is Right&quot;, &quot;Te Amo Camila Vallejo&quot;, and &quot;The Underground Man&quot;. Payola is the follow-up album to the first and only Desaparecidos album, Read Music / Speak Spanish. Influenced by &#39;70s/&#39;80s punk & hardcore like T.S.O.L. and Cro-Mags; early &#39;80s power-pop the Vapors and Tommy Tutone, Payola was co-produced with Mike Mogis (First Aid Kit, Saintseneca, and &#39;The Fault in our Stars&#39; Score From the Motion Picture with Nate Walcott); and was recorded in several batches over the past few years. On Payola, the band consciously tackled a wide range of political issues at a much broader scale. It has a greater degree of focus and musicality than the first release. Payola is more raw, louder, and angrier. In addition to the 6 previously released tracks, the album also includes 8 new tracks from the band. A band that never fully came into fruition is finally getting their due with their sophomore release only 13 short years later.

Since the release of their debut album Carry The Fire in the summer of 2012 and 2013&#39;s follow-up EP Chasing Twisters, Delta Rae has been profiled everywhere from NPR and Time to Forbes. Rolling Stone proclaimed that &quot;if Fleetwood Mac came up in North Carolina, they might resemble Delta Rae.&quot; VH1 hand selected them for their &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; Artist Of The Month program, and they performed not once, but twice on both The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Conan. Live is where Delta Rae truly flourish, having spent the last year and a half playing to sold out venues from coast to coast, even sharing the stage with First Lady Michelle Obama when they performed during a Democratic rally at UNC Chapel Hill. They&#39;ve played pretty much every festival under the sun, including Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits and Voodoo, and are excited to be hitting the road again this fall.   TICKET INFORMATION  • Great American Music Hall is an ALL-AGES (6+) venue. • No refunds or exchanges are permitted. • Once you purchase, you will receive an order confirmation email from Eventbrite on behalf of Slim’s Presents. • IMPORTANT: If you do not see your order confirmation in your inbox, make sure to check your junk/spam folder.

Alex Sibley is quickly becoming a recognizable name in the house/techno scene.<br><br> Bio:<br><br> Sibley grew up travelling back and forth between Athens, Greece and the San Francisco Bay area. His frequent visits to Greece allowed him to experience the European club life at an early age. During his stay in Greece he moved to Mykonos, where he instantly fell in love with the house and techno scene. His return to the US inspired him to expose the underground vibe of music he experienced abroad. Four years later and Alex has not only made a name for himself as a dj, (playing big venues and festivals such as Insomniac&#39;s Escape From Wonderland, Burning Man, Lovevolution, Ruby Skye, Mezzanine, Vessel, the End Up ect.) but he has also become a recognized producer. His productions have been picked up by internationally recognized labels like Bashi Records, Blue Orb records and Spundae Black and has had his tracks featured on Umek and Carl Cox&#39;s radioshows (Behind the Iron Curtain, Intec Digital radioshow)<br><br> Alex has had the privilege to be on the same lineup as some of the best producers in the world including Richie Hawtin, Gui Borratto, Carlo Lio, Pan-Pot, Dubfire, Loco Dice, Moby, Armin Van Buuren, Calvin Harris, Markus Shultz, Gareth Emery, etc. <br>Dem Suckas<br>DEMSUCKAZ originated out of the DJing and production interests of longtime live performers Rick Frye (onefiftyfive) and William Payne&#39;s (Billy Bokteen) experimental percussion and DJ act known as Alpaca Bull. In a Berlin-trip-inspired-summer the foundations for DEMSUCKAZ were laid in Albuquerque, NM. After returning to the bay, they have sought their own interpretations of the SF electronic scene and have been bolstered by the skills and sounds of artists Loud Mouth (SF), Coda (ABQ), and Mantranova (SF)."], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s1.evcdn.com/store/skin/no_image/categories/128x128/other.jpg"], ["name", "HOBO ( Soundz / Minus / Canada) / ALEX SIBLEY / DEM SUCKAS"], ["start_time", "2015-06-13"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-21 16:59:50.136057"], ["venue", "Monarch"]]

The duo&#39;s, reputation precedes them as international party animals but is eclipsed only by the accolades awarded to them for their groundbreaking and original style of music and remarkable performances the world over. <br><br> Art Department&#39;s undeniable, game-changing contribution to the electronic music landscape has landed the prolific producers at the forefront of a major underground movement. The pair has <br> transcended genre barriers and broken down walls as few other underground artists have, garnering accolades including #1 track of the year at the Beatport Awards in 2011, iTunes #2 “Best Electronic Album” of 2011, hailed as “hottest duo in dance music” from outlets like DJ Mag, awarded the 2010 Track of the Year for their breakout hit Without You by long standing authorities like Resident Advisor (UK), Groove Mag (Germany), and #2 in Mixmag (US), and voted #6 Top DJ&#39;s in the world in 2012. The duo have also graced the covers of DJMag Canada, Now Magazine, DJ Times, Raveline Magazine and have been featured in wide spread press, including The Guardian, Rolling Stone, Vogue, I:D, Nylon and Vibe Magazine who ranked them #2 DJ/Producers in the world in 2013, second only to Daft Punk, firmly establishing them as a rare thing in the world of electronic music.<br><br> Since the project’s inception in 2009, there has been no looking back. Art Department have since been installed as CircoLoco residents at arguably the most revered club on earth—DC10; upon request have taken their immersive live show to esteemed nightclubs like Fabric and Panorama Bar; have been invited to perform at trendsetting international festivals like DEMF (Detroit), Ultra Music Festival (Miami), EDC (Las Vegas), BPM (Mexico), Exit Festival (Serbia), Optimus Alive (Portugal), Electric Forest (Grand rapids), Parklife (UK/Oz), Creamfields (South America), Global gathering (UK), Lollapalooza (Chicago), Coachella (California) and Digital Dreams (Toronto). In 2012 They reached yet another milestone when the duo were welcome guests on the legendary BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix and at the BBC’s hallowed Maida Vail studios joining company with The Rolling Stones and The Beatles.<br><br> Art Department’s sonic cannon Without You arrived sounding fully formed in 2010, a track so unique and original that it set the world of electronic music a blaze. Since then the pair have continued to hone their original and remix production skills most notably, on White’s own much-lauded imprint, No.19 Music, with the jewel in their crown—the impressive debut album The Drawing Board released on the prestigious Crosstown Rebels label. <br><br> The infamous pair, has recently completed their eagerly anticipated second full length studio album set for release late 2014.<br><br> Sitting atop her throne as the Queen of Crosstown Rebels, Francesca has cultivated a sound that is all her own. Representative of her multi-disciplinary musical background, Francesca’s music transcends the dance floor; each track providing an emotional narrative, full of wistful dreamy soundscapes, stirring melodies, deep, hypnotic rhythms and her unforgettable vocals. <br><br> Francesca’s classical musical training started on piano at the age of 6 but she’d already picked up her first microphone at just 4 years of age. The Italian-born musician has been part of the electronic music scene for more than 15 years, but it is in house and techno where she carved out her own path in the last few years. In that time she has criss-crossed the globe several times over, as a DJ and live performer, in tandem with building up a formidable back catalogue of music. 2015 welcomes a new phase of Francesca’s career as she prepares to unveil her debut album, a collection of work that will truly represent the essence of what she is all about; forward-thinking, experimenting, well-crafted, thoughtful and, most importantly, made from the heart. <br><br> In 2012 came the first release of many with Damian Lazarus’ superlative label, Crosstown Rebels. Two years later she is continuously traveling the world to play DJ sets at events from Chile to Australia and everywhere in between. Her unique ability to combine mesmerising rhythms with emotive melodies and dramatic stories through her journey-like sets makes Francesca the DJ who is called upon during those very special moments, adding her unique soundtrack to the sunrise at Burning Man or performing into the midnight ceremony atop the pyramids at Day Zero. <br><br> Along the way she has ticked off every respected club on the planet including Fabric (London), Panorama Bar (Berlin), DC10 (Ibiza), Verboten (New York), Space (Ibiza), Warehouse Project (Manchester), Cocoricó (Italy) and many, many more. She also counts several nominations for ‘Breakthrough Artist Of The Year’ among her ever-growing list of achievements. Despite all of this Francesca refuses to relent, pushing her boundaries even further by conceiving a live set incorporating a group of instrumentalists; collaborating to compose and conduct intricate new productions. In 2013 she showcased the live performance via Boiler Room and only a few months later, Francesca performed the live debut at Day Zero in Mexico. The full orchestral performance is due to be debuted at Wonderfruit Festival in Bangkok, where Francesca will perform with the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra. <br><br> Live instrumentalists also feature on her album, merging the world of electronic music with Francesca’s classical upbringing. Taking her music beyond the dance floor, it’s music made to uplift, enlighten and engage people from all walks of life. The outcome is a combination of grand and orchestral compositions, together with subtle, nuanced numbers – a healthy balance that epitomises Francesca’s sound ethic; mature, refined and powerful, permeating into your subconscious and resonating deep within your soul. <br><br> Francesca’s striking vocals wash over the crowd with waves of emotion as she performs her final track ‘Call Me Wrong’. Surrounded by the powdery golden dust of the deep Playa, thousands of brightly-coloured Burners assembled in front of the Robot Heart Bus are struggling to breathe through the dust storm but persevere, inspired by the sultry rhythms emanating from the speakers. There’s a unifying force keeping them there, everyone is locked in to Francesca’s utterly contagious positivity, they stop in awe as the beats, melodies and vocals become one with their aura. In this very moment there’s nowhere else anyone would rather be; the desert sun is burning, they’re covered in dust and they feel truly alive. The music comes to an end and, in unison, they break out into an impromptu rendition of Happy Birthday, as this is her special day. These are the moments we live for and these are the moments that are perfectly suited to Francesca Lombardo…<br><br> There’s no doubt that Francesca’s passion and drive to keep innovating within the dance music spectrum is unsurpassed and it is the fuel that will keep her inspired, relevant and soundtracking the very best moments of our lives for many years to come.</p></p>"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s4.evcdn.com/images/block250/I0-001/018/360/383-3.jpeg_/onon-presents-art-department-francesca-lombardo-tr-83.jpeg"], ["name", "On&On presents Art Department, Francesca Lombardo, Trey Courtney and special guest Kenny Glasgow at Mezzanine"], ["start_time", "2015-06-26"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-21 16:59:50.141503"], ["venue", "Mezzanine"]]

Having hosted speakers as diverse as Sheryl Sandberg, Dan Savage and Rachel Maddow, INFORUM now invites SF’s finest citizens to support its onstage interviews by mingling and intellectualizing with a purpose. It’s a celebration, a meeting of the minds, but definitely a party. \n\nGuests are set to enjoy music from two of the city’s most sought after DJ talents: Popstack and Slaptop (the latter is on the verge of being the next big thing with upcoming performances at the Greek Theatre and Lollapalooza). It’s going to definitely be one of those “hot” San Francisco nights, as attendees swing and sway with SF young luminaries like Facebook’s Libby Leffler and Yelp’s Nish Nadaraja, all while enjoying complimentary eats from Chambers and drinks courtesy of ONEHOPE, Lagunitas and Suerte Tequila. \n\nIt gets better: everyone in attendance will also receive a free raffle ticket for prizes that include an AirBNB coupon code for $250, and 2 VIP party experience tickets for Kim Kardashian West Live  (front tier seating, a signed copy of Kim’s latest book Selfish, and a chance to meet the star herself!)\n\nThe Details:\nWhat: A party-style fundraiser complete with complimentary food catered by Chambers, an open bar, music from 2 top DJs, and plenty of the above mingling and social intellectualizing.\n \nWhere: Chambers, located inside the iconic Phoenix Hotel, itself a San Francisco landmark opened by former Commonwealth Club guest Chip Conley.\nAddress: 601 Eddy Street, San Francisco, CA 94109\n \nWhen: 7-11pm on Thursday, June 25th\n \nWhy: Proceeds from the event help bolster INFORUM’s work to bring conversations to the Bay Area. By hosting these onstage interviews, INFORUM has addressed issues such as diversity in tech with Kimberly Bryant and Sal Khan, reproductive rights with Cecile Richards, and racial justice with Cornel West.\n \nHost Committee Chair Nish Nadaraja on why: “&quot;The term &#39;curation&#39; gets thrown around a lot these days. But that&#39;s really what INFORUM is all about: curating discussions and topics that matter to you. This event is a call-out to support the type of discourse and programming that keeps SF vital and purposefully diverse.&quot;"], ["end_time", "2015-06-25"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s2.evcdn.com/images/block250/I0-001/020/149/417-5.png_/inforum-informal-17.png"], ["name", "INFORUM Informal"], ["start_time", "2015-06-25"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-21 16:59:54.231516"], ["venue", "Chambers Eat + Drink"]]

He was suffering a bout of homesickness. Intermittently, it can get to him. So when he eventually got round to clicking on Mark Leckey’s Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore, it was as if a hand was wrapping around his shoulder, reminding him of everything he holds dear and romantic about the margins of the national dancefloor that interest him most, back home. “I became obsessed with it,” he says.<br> Leckey’s 14.45m video montage from 1999 cuts directly at the intersection between the flippancy and seriousness, the beauty and lunacy of British dance music culture, its timeline travelling from the working class theatrics of Northern Soul through the wide-eyed euphoria of acid house. There is an intermittent stopover to peer at depressed parochial 80’s shopping centres, providing a perfect counterbalance for the functionality of disco in all its myriad forms through the British psyche.<br> The piece connected directly, magically with the material Jamie had been working on while fashioning his first solo record, In Colour. If Hardcore looks like our mirrorball past and future, wrapped into one stop-start curiosity kaleidoscope, In Colour sounds like it. Jamie’s music is blessed with the same streamlined polarity of looking back to enable moving forward. This is his major gift to the British dance music conversation. <br> In January this year, Jamie xx stepped aside from the mixing desk of his solitary studio bunker space in Old Street and decided that In Colour was finished. It had been three years since he had began work on the first cut that suggested he had a solo record in him, Girl. Both the title and carefully calibrated, vibrant accompanying graphic design imagery for the album are a deliberate delineation away from the chic monochromes that have marked his work with The xx. “I wouldn’t have called it In Colour if the record had sounded dark”, he notes. When he began the project, not even knowing where it would take him, he was well aware of that possibility. “That could have happened.” Yet in his time in the band, Jamie has touched if not exact extroversion, at least moments of private joy. This was the record, it seemed, to spell those out. <br> On deciding that work was at a natural conclusion, he hung up his headphones for a week and invited everyone that would be working on the record to listen to it. The garrulous nature of the songs surprised him. Suggestions were made for a running order. When he finally found one that made him happy, a fully realised record sprang out, that ran with something of the quietly climactic urgency of his DJ sets. It was a record that spoke in rangy textures of soul, gospel, hip-hop and every mutation of the purity of house music that has twisted its way into a new sub-genre since 1986. Yet it sounded exactly like him. “It wasn’t just a series of unconnected ideas anymore”, he says. “It was an album. It felt… positive.” This was an important blossoming moment in Jamie’s musical time frame.<br> In Colour mirrors the special skill-set that has turned Jamie into one of the major DJ draws at the sophisticated end of the global nightlife spectrum. Beginning with the bold, insistent rush of Gosh the record sets out its magnificent stall early. Traces of break-beat and clipped techno can he heard in his countenance of its rhythm track. “It was supposed to be the final track on the record, in my head.” It was the last to be finished. “It was much faster. Then I slowed it down by 20-30% and the beat sounded harder, grittier somehow. The massive synth line began to kick against it and I started to feel that moment of euphoria I’m always looking for when I’m making music. That is the end goal.” He says it doesn’t happen often. But when it does, he knows. Within the grand, reedy melody that builds midway through the track, Jamie seems to hit a tangent somewhere between rave’s blaring air-horns, a riff from an old, dusted-off New Romantic curiosity and the sweep and ballast of a classical string solo. <br> Jamie has a fastidious, perfectionist’s approach to making music. “I work and work and work until I drive myself mad trying to find something that makes sense to me.” He is his own fiercest critic. “It never sounds good enough. I was pulling my hair out trying to make all this fit together when Gosh happened and pulled it all into one place.” A suite was born.<br> Jamie says that he didn’t have to have a specific conversation with his band-mates asking for a day release permission pass to work on a solo album. There was, furthermore, never any question that Romy and Oliver from The xx would be involved with vocals on the record. “We owe everything to one another. I couldn’t have made it without them. We know each other so well that we understand we have to do other things.” They operate on agreed telepathy. As early as the finishing of their first album, Jamie had taken side-projects, fashioning a radical reworking of Gil Scott-Heron’s I’m New Here album, remixing for Florence and The Machine and Adele and then as an unlikely baton passing America’s commercial R&B fraternity into new waters with productions for Rihanna, Alicia Keys and Drake.<br> Romy provides two vocals, first on the breakout single, Loud Places, which manages to weave a simple pop verse delivered at a melancholy angle with a chorus sample Jamie has always tried to make work in one of his own songs, from Idris Muhammed’s crate-digger’s classic, Could Heaven Ever Feel Like This? “The sample was a last attempt to make Romy’s beautiful words make sense. When it slotted into place it was the album’s eureka moment.” Since Loud Places was first aired, Jamie has played two DJ gigs, at Knoxville and Athens, Georgia. “At both, people were shouting for me to play it.” For her second contribution, Jamie reworked his collaboration with Four Tet, SeeSaw, then asked Romy to sing along to herself in the studio.<br> When it came to recording Oliver on the rousing intimacies of Stranger In A Room, things were less experimental. “He works differently. It’s not about trying things out with Oliver. It’s about waiting until the right thing happens. But when it does, you know it will be perfect.”<br> Other guest stars joined the party. When The xx played their feted shows at the Manhattan Armory, an aggrandised extension of the tiny shows they’d fashioned for the Manchester International Festival, Jamie spent two months living in Brooklyn. “I’d travel into the city every day across the bridge, watching the skyline listening to Hot 97 FM and it made me fall in love with hip hop again.” His reaction to this is I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times), in which he deploys the skills of Young Thug, whose Lifestyle had become a perennial favourite, alongside Jamaican dancehall star Popcaan. “With rappers, you always know there will be a positive response, but Young Thug sent back a perfect finished lyric within two days. So I knew he really liked the track.”<br> The resulting album is Jamie’s calling card: his surprise to himself and all those who thought they knew exactly what The xx are and what they do. There are no limitations. This is a brand new horizon, one that is playing delightfully back into the fashioning of their third record. “The best music I make,” says Jamie, “is when I lock myself away and feel like I exist in a space that is close to nowhere. Where nothing else matters but sound.” It is his dream state. On In Colour, that state is realised."], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s3.evcdn.com/images/block250/I0-001/004/226/110-5.png_/jamie-xx-10.png"], ["name", "Jamie xx - Young Marco, DJ Dials"], ["performer", "Jamie xx, Dj Dials"], ["start_time", "2015-07-27"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-21 17:23:09.539416"], ["venue", "Bimbo's 365 Club"]]

Jesse Ray Smith had ventured from Marin to San Francisco with The Pheromones, acquired ‘Gulch Alley Studios’, and co-founded acclaimed blues-soul rock outfit The Bad Jones. Simultaneously, Seattle rock theater drummer John Hollis (Hedwig, Ian Moore, Gerald Collier, Burning Opera SF) headed south from the soggy, forested Northwest music scene after a residency in SF with The Burning Opera.

He’s making lasting impressions on everyone that watches his talent, and inspiring people with his passion! Born on march 29 1985. Jake was born with cerebral palsy, limiting the use of his legs. He was always determined to never let that bring him down. So he lived a very active life as a young kid and participated in every sport he could. He played wheelchair basketball, and was the inspiration to start a baseball league for children with special needs. Jake comes from a family that has a long line of professional cowboys. He grew up in the rodeo scene and wanted to ride calves at a very young age. He was the only cowboy that couldn’t walk and was an instant hit. Soon he was sponsored to ride all over the west coast and made a lot of buzz in the media. There were newspaper articles and magazine write ups on him, he gained a lot of respect and inspired a lot of people at a very young age. He did this until he was 13 years old. Sometime during his adolescence he discovered music. He was 15 when he first started playing guitar, and caught on very quickly. He was 17 when he formed his first reggae/rock band FUBAR. Together this band accomplished a lot. They played in many different festivals, and opened up for some many great bands like Passafire, Ballyhoo, Opio, Isreal Vibrations, Mike Pinto, Rebelution and many more. They won the Monterey Battle of the Bands in 2007 and a Swagg Award for best reggae album in 2010. At some point though Jake felt the calling to play some blues. He started collaborating and touring with Jr. Boogie, a well known harmonica player in the Bay Area and Chris Weinress, a talented bass player with many years of experience. Together they played all over Northern California and opened for such bands as Elvin Bishop, Roy Rogers and Travis Warren of Blind Melon. This is where Jake felt his true calling and started playing at pro jams and working with blues musicians all over the area. This is how he met the very talented Derrick Martin, a drummer that had been working with the legendary Little Richard for the past 15 years and was looking for some new act to add to his agenda. That was when Jake, Chris and Derrick came together to form Jake Nielsen’s Triple Threat. They were instant magic. Everyone that saw them play were blown away by the performance they put on. Packed with so much energy and funk that you have to get out of your seat and dance! Together these guys have conquered it all! Headlining in many festivals all over California, and already making their international debut in Canada, they also have their first album self titled Jake Nielsen’s Triple Threat available on Itunes. Already working on album #2. And you can hear some of their songs in movies and commercials. Jake has been featured on the radio, tv shows, newspapers and magazine articles for his music, but also for being an inspiration to people who see him. He collaborates with other artists and has made an album called Raps N Blues with well known rapper Ghambit, and still goes back to his reggae roots now and then. But either way he does it Jake Nielsen is making a name for himself in the music industry, guaranteed you will hear more from him!<br>$5 – www.boomboomtickets.com & at Door"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s1.evcdn.com/images/block250/I0-001/017/556/016-2.jpeg_/jake-nielsens-triple-threat-16.jpeg"], ["name", "JAKE NIELSEN’s TRIPLE THREAT"], ["start_time", "2015-06-24"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-21 17:23:09.594150"], ["venue", "Boom Boom Room"]]

He&#39;s also established himself as a singular presence on the Brazilian scene, spending at least a few months of every year there since 2000. JazzWeekly called Wainapel’s playing “music that restores the soul.”"], ["end_time", "2015-08-07"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s2.evcdn.com/images/block250/I0-001/020/037/953-2.jpeg_/danny-green-trio-harvey-wainapel-53.jpeg"], ["name", "Danny Green Trio with Harvey Wainapel"], ["start_time", "2015-08-07"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-21 17:23:09.606052"], ["venue", "Red Poppy Art House"]]

The evening will feature a pre-program reception and bring together experts in the field, including General James E. Cartwright, former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former commander of the US nuclear forces who has a unique insider view into the threats posed by a nuclear arsenal; Reza Aslan, the bestselling author of Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth and No God But God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam; and Barbara Slavin, a Ploughshares Fund grantee, author, journalist and Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council and noted expert in Middle East issues.\n&quot;In periods of heightened tensions and reduced decision times, the likelihood of human and technical error in control systems increases,&quot; said General James E. Cartwright, former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. &quot;Launch-on-warning is a relic of Cold War strategy whose risk today far exceeds its value. Our leaders urgently need to talk and, we hope, agree to scrap this obsolete protocol before a devastating error occurs.&quot; &quot;The historic agreement reached with Iran could potentially, for the first time, put that country&#39;s nuclear program in an iron box with a camera on it,&quot; said Joe Cirincione, President of Ploughshares Fund. &quot;We are delighted to bring our guest speakers together in a discussion that explores the broader context of these issues and why it is so important to seize this opportunity with Iran.&quot;\nIn addition, the evening will feature a special interactive pop-up exhibit from N Square. The special one-night-only exhibit explores how 21st-century innovation can accelerate progress toward the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. A new initiative sponsored by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, Ploughshares Fund, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and Skoll Global Threats Fund, N Square was created to catalyze innovation that moves the world toward disarmament while improving global safety and security in the meantime.\nSince 1981, Ploughshares Fund has led and invested in initiatives to reduce and ultimately eliminate the world&#39;s nuclear threats and to promote stability in regions of conflict."], ["end_time", "2015-06-08"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s1.evcdn.com/store/skin/no_image/categories/128x128/other.jpg"], ["name", "Ploughshares Fund Chain Reaction 2015"], ["start_time", "2015-06-08"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-21 17:23:14.123998"], ["venue", "Futures without Violence�۪s Open Square Conference Center in the Presidio"]]

Come out for a guided hike and experience this special place! Sutro Stewards have partnered with Beers Made by Walking, a program that invites people to step outside and see the place they live in a new light. Each hike will be attended by local brewers, who are challenged to create unique, place-based beers that serve as drinkable, landscape portraits inspired by the trails. A tapping event will take place this fall to showcase these beers. Proceeds benefit Sutro Stewards! The hikes will start from the Sutro Nursery at 195 Behr Ave, San Francisco 94131, where Behr Ave meets Johnston Dr. Parking spots marked &quot;ALDEA Center Parking&quot; will be free for participants during the hike. We suggest wearing long pants, layers, and sturdy, closed-toed shoes. You may also consider a notebook and/or camera to document the plants you see along the trail. TICKET IS REQUIRED. SPACE IS LIMITED.

Some, like those in Rocky Horror Picture Show were celebrated. Others, like those in Cruising, Silence of the Lambs, and Basic Instinct were met with protests. While many of these on-screen depictions were originally denounced by queer communities, some of the most celebrated horror filmmakers have been queer identified, including James Whale (Frankenstein), Joel Schumacher (The Lost Boys), Don Mancini (Child’s Play), Clive Barker (Hellraiser) and Lana Wachowski (The Matrix). From camp classics, to homophobic and transphobic exploitation, to creatures created by queer identified filmmakers, we’ll take on the queer monsters of cinema. We&#39;ll explore their characterization and impact through communal viewing of scenes from monster movies, engaging dialogue, personal writing, art-making, and dramatic play. The event will be held at 2269 Market Street in the Castro. Tickets are $40.00 and available at https://monsterpride.eventbrite.com.\nAbout the Facilitator:  Doug Ronning RDT/BCT, is a produced screenwriter (HBO’s Tales from the Crypt), a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist  (#MFC 51086), and a lifelong fan of creature features. \nFuture events in the series include:\nSinister States, Vile Ventures, & Cut-Throat Consortiums: Politics & Corporations as Monster on July 11; and Perilous Love, Toxic Desire, & Twisted Attachment: Romance, Mating, & Attraction as Monster on August 8. Each highly interactive experiential workshop will be held on a Saturday afternoon from 1:00pm to 4:00pm. \nAttend the remaining events in the series, three three-hour events for only $110! Save $10 and ticket fees!\nPurchase Series Tickets at https://mmsthriplethreat.eventbrite.com\n\nNow in it&#39;s fourth year, Monster Movie Salon celebrates the monsters of cinema by producing interactive events that go beyond passive film watching to inspire personal and community engagement.\nFor more information please visit http://monstermoviesalon.com."], ["end_time", "2015-06-13"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s1.evcdn.com/store/skin/no_image/categories/128x128/other.jpg"], ["name", "Monster Movie Salon presents Sapphic Vamps, Dangerous Dandies, & Transexual Transylvanians"], ["start_time", "2015-06-13"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-21 17:23:15.479344"], ["venue", "2269 Market Street"]]

It was Wills’ music that first reached the troubled young Haggard when his brother gave his battered guitar to the then twelve year old as a gift, and it remained a constant as the troubled youth bounced from juvenile detention to jail before embracing music as a path to turn his life around. An inmate at San Quentin prison in 1958, Haggard attended Cash’s first-ever prison performance, which was the inspiration for Haggard to finally clean up his act for good. The momentous career that followed saw Haggard inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1977 and the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1994. He was named a Kennedy Center honoree in 2010. Haggard’s latest album is his best-selling 2015 collaboration with fellow country legend Willie Nelson, <em>Django and Jimmie</em>, their salute to gypsy guitar pioneer Django Reinhardt and early country vocal star Jimmie Rodgers.<br><br><strong>Artist Website</strong><br><br><a href=\"http://merlehaggard.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">merlehaggard.com</a><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;As singer, instrumentalist and songwriter, Merle Haggard has few peers in the soul-tearing world of country music &quot; — People Magazine<br><br><br><br><br>&quot;…he remains a master performer, storyteller and bandleader &quot; — Rolling Stone<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s1.evcdn.com/images/block250/I0-001/004/230/896-5.jpeg_/merle-haggard-96.jpeg"], ["name", "Merle Haggard"], ["performer", "Merle Haggard"], ["start_time", "2015-12-04 20:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-22 21:34:45.185796"], ["venue", "SFJAZZ"]]

Sandoval began studying classical trumpet at the age of twelve, but it didn&#39;t take him long to catch the excitement of the jazz world. He has since evolved into one of the world&#39;s most acknowledged guardians of jazz trumpet and flugel horn, as well as a renowned classical artist, pianist and composer.He is one of the most dynamic and vivacious live performers of our time, and has been seen by millions in the Oscars and Grammy Awards performing with Celine Dione, Justin Timberlake as well as on the Latin Billboard Awards with the gifted Alicia Keys, where he was awarded his 6th Billboard Awards for &quot;Best Latin Jazz Album&quot;. Sandoval has been awarded 6 Grammy Awards, and nominated 12 times; he has also received 6 Billboard Awards and one Emmy Award. The latter for his composing work on the entire underscore of the HBO movie based on his life, &quot;For Love or Country&quot; starring Andy Garcia. His last album &quot;Time for Love&quot; had three Grammy nominations and won two; for best album and best production. He is currently working on two new albums, &quot;Tribute to Dizzy Gillespie&quot; and &quot; Tangos &quot;, along with working on a new book chronicling his relationship with Dizzy Gillespie. Sandoval was a founding member of the Grammy Award-winning group Irakere, whose explosive mixture of jazz, classical, rock and traditional Cuban music caused a sensation throughout the entertainment world. In 1981, he left Irakere to form his own band, which garnered enthusiastic praise from critics and audiences all over the world, and continues to do so.Arturo Sandoval is a retired tenured professor from Florida International University after a prosperous 19 years. Nevertheless, he still works nationally and abroad with innumerable universities and institutions and their music departments offering several scholarships, exercise books, clinics and seminars, and has rendered a considerable amount of time working with the NARAS educational program. He now offers a complete Artist-In-Residence program as well. Arturo Sandoval maintains one of the most extensive educational programs in the industry. He has written four books with one of the most prestigious publishing companies in the industry &quot;Hal Leonard&quot;, of which they continue to sell around all the world. Sandoval is also a renowned classical musician, performing regularly with the leading symphony orchestras from around the world. Arturo has composed his own &quot;Concerto for Trumpet & Orchestra&quot;, which can be heard on &quot;Arturo Sandoval: &quot;The Classical Album.&quot; Arturo has performed with the foremost orchestras in the country as well as abroad and recorded John Williams&#39; Trumpet Concerto with the London Symphony Orchestra. His classical artistry has earned him the respect and admiration from the most prestigious conductors, composers and symphony orchestras worldwide. Arturo Sandoval&#39;s versatility can be heard on recordings with everyone from Dizzy Gillespie, Woody Herman, Woody Shaw, Michel Legrand, Bill Conti, and Stan Getz to Johnny Mathis, Frank Sinatra, Paul Anka, Rod Stewart and Alicia Keys amongst many others. He has performed with John Williams with the Boston Pops, and in the Super bowl with Tony Bennet and Patti LaBelle. His compositions can also be heard on Dave Grusin&#39;s soundtrack for &quot;Havana&quot; and &quot;Random Heart&quot;, in the &quot;Mambo Kings&quot; soundtrack with his Grammy nominated composition &quot;Mambo Caliente&quot;, in the soundtrack of &quot;The Perez Family&quot;, &quot;61&quot;, &quot;Mr. Wrong&quot;, the documentary &quot;Oscar&quot;, and &quot;The Family Fuentes&quot; among of others. He also was commissioned by the Kennedy Center to compose the music for the ballet &quot;Pepito&#39;s Story&quot;, &quot;Soul Possessed&quot;, as well as &quot;Oman O Men&quot;, and &quot;The Chocolate Hot Nutcracker, choreographed by Debbie Allen. And as mentioned above, he was awarded an Emmy for his composing work on the entire underscore of the HBO movie based on his life, &quot;For Love or Country&quot; starring Andy Garcia.Arturo Sandoval reaches beyond the scope of mere effort. His struggles while in Cuba and since his defection have given him more energy and strength, urging him to accomplish and surpass his childhood dreams. Filled with a virtuoso capability, he desires nothing more than to share his gift with others who feel the same intense adoration for music as he does. One frequently speaks of Arturo Sandoval&#39;s virtuoso technical ability or his specialty in high notes, but he who has seen him on the piano, lyrically improvising a ballad, or has had the opportunity to enjoy the diversity of his music, through his compositions from the most straight ahead jazz, Latin jazz or classical, knows that Arturo Sandoval is a prominent musician, and one recognizes that Arturo is one of the most brilliant, multifaceted and renowned musicians of our time."], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s1.evcdn.com/images/block250/I0-001/000/364/020-6.jpg_/arturo-sandoval-20.jpg"], ["name", "Arturo Sandoval"], ["performer", "Arturo Sandoval"], ["start_time", "2015-07-03 20:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-22 21:34:45.212119"], ["venue", "Yoshi's - Jack London Square"]]

Your child will learn everything necessary to build and customize their first app. We provide an introduction to programming, Swift, and Xcode. Kids enjoy seeing the immediate results of their learnings and taking control of what happens on an iPad or iPhone screen. At the end of the camp, your child will have learned: How the Apple development workflow is structured How to setup and work with Xcode How to build a simple app using Swift Programming basics Swift basics   Your child will leave camp with a basic understanding of development and the ability to modify the app they created in-class.  The camp is designed for kids who are highly motivated by programming and interested in learning new skills. Typical grade levels are 5-8. We’ll include some fun outdoor activities at lunch time. This will be the third season of our programming camps. Last year&#39;s winter session was quite successful in helping kids learn Java. Every attendee rated the camp 10 out of 10, and one parent noted: I enrolled my 10-year old son in Jack Youstra’s Java/Minecraft class. Jack made the class fun and informational. He explained the material and asked questions for the kids to answer. While his focus was to teach, his goal was to make the experience fun, so that the kids don’t get intimidated by the tech. I would recommend Jack’s class to other kids. - Phu Hoang (parent)      EA Tour As part of the camp, we will be offering a tour to Electronic Arts Headquarters at Redwood Shores. This tour will be on 6/30/15 from 1:00pm to 3:00pm. Due to transportation time, your child will be back at approximately 3:45. This is a great opportunity to tour a hub of game production. In this tour, your child will be able to   Explore the campus and operations of a professional game company Speak to a professional game programmer about a career in game programming and design Purchase games and other merchandise at the employee discount store Camp Details Daily Schedule           9:00  Dropoff - bring laptop & lunch  9:00 - 10:30  Instruction / exercises / programming 10:30 - 10:40  Break 10:40 - 12:10  Instruction / exercises / programming 12:10 - 12:50  Lunch & outdoor activities 12:50 -  1:50  Instruction / exercises / programming  1:50 -  2:00  Break  2:00 -  3:00  Instruction / exercises / programming          3:00  Pickup Materials Campers are responsible for bringing their own Apple laptops and lunches.

In my home town of Be&#39;er Sheva we had one printing shop that had their printing machine at the window. I remember standing outside waiting for my prints to be printed, and it gave me so much joy seeing my prints coming out of the machine. Currently, I live in Marin County, California, am married, and have a sweet boy who runs away every time he sees a camera pointing at him.<br><br>About China Camp<br>China Camp has long since provided visitors with unsurpassed hiking and mountain biking trails, scenic vistas, salt marshes, wildlife, and meadows and rugged open spaces. Its designation as a state park was established in 1976, due, in large part, to the efforts of the founding members of the nonprofit organization, Friends of China Camp. In an early Environmental Impact Report written in 1974 by Bob Young, a Marin Conservation League volunteer at the time, China Camp is described as &quot;the last place in the entire Bay Area where an unimpaired natural landscape stretches from Bay shore to mountain top.&quot; <br><br>This exhibit is co-sponsored by the Osher Marin JCC and Leib Ostrow. In partnership with Friends of China Camp and the Marin Conservation League. <p>\n\nMORE INFO: <br>Website: <a href=\"http://www.marinjcc.org/events/2015/06/24/jewish-life/gallery-reception-china-camp/55905/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.marinjcc.org/events/2015/06/24/jewish-life/gallery-reception-china-camp/55905/</a> <br>Email:   <a href=\"mailto:hsanders@marinjcc.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">hsanders@marinjcc.org</a> <br>Phone:   455-444-8000 \n\nSubmitted by the <a href=\"http://www.fullcalendar.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>FullCalendar Event Promotion Service</strong></a></p>"], ["end_time", "2015-06-24 19:00:00.000000"], ["free", "f"], ["name", "Osher Levi China Camp: A Photographic Journey"], ["start_time", "2015-06-24 17:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-22 21:34:53.415324"], ["venue", "Osher Marin Jewish Community Center"]]

This time we recruited three tech-industry leaders whose work overlaps in meaningful ways with the nonprofits world, either as funders or collaborators. You&#39;ll hear their stories, join the dialogue, and walk away with actionable and insightful information. We believe open dialogue and education is the first step in bridging the gap between technology companies and nonprofits in our community. All three of our Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have both meaningful nonprofit experience and significant business acumen, so this should be an exciting and highly anticipated forum.   Meet the speakers... Roderick Campbell - Moderator CEO and cofounder of CommitChange, America&#39;s fastest growing nonprofit software company. Funded by Mark Cuban and Tim Draper. Featured in Forbes, Nonprofit Quarterly, and Fundraising Success magazine. Michael White - ActOn and SV2 VP at National Semiconductor for 12 years. Partner and board member at Silicon Valley Social Venture Fund. Experienced in venture capital. Now launching ActOn, a social venture that connects supporters with causes. Eric Facas - Media Cause After spending 4 years developing Google&#39;s advertising platform, Eric founded Media Cause which now has a reputation as one of the world&#39;s leading nonprofit marketing and development agencies.   You&#39;ll learn about... Ways to steward relationships inside tech companies, emerging technologies that will impact your work, innovative fundraising strategies, the successes and failures of funding models, and lots more.

Jung San is known for his meticulous  and complex works,  which he infuses with his Buddhist ideas. His work often contains unconventional materials, such as razorblades, nail polish, and matchboxes. These innovative pieces leave viewers in both deep contemplation and wonder.<br><br>This May, Jung San returns with the second part of his &#39;Beyond Words Series&#39;, which  illustrates his development as an artist. For this show, Jung San wrote countless stories in calligraphy on handmade paper, which were then folded and combined  to form several pieces of art.  For Jung San, the &#39;Beyond Words Series&#39;  reflect his belief that even when words are obscured or silenced, they still have  meaning. Jung San&#39;s new works convey these ideas through their freeform exuberance, which contrasts well with the clean lines that defined Part 1 of the &#39;Beyond Words Series.&#39; Please join us May 7th from 5:30-7:30 pm at the show opening to celebrate the return of this phenomenal artist. <p>\n\nMORE INFO: <br>Website: <a href=\"http://sandraleegallery.com/upcoming-exhibitions/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sandraleegallery.com/upcoming-exhibitions/</a> <br>Email:   <a href=\"mailto:art@sandraleegallery.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">art@sandraleegallery.com</a> <br>Phone:   415-291-8000 \n\nSubmitted by the <a href=\"http://www.fullcalendar.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>FullCalendar Event Promotion Service</strong></a></p>"], ["end_time", "2015-05-07 19:30:00.000000"], ["free", "f"], ["name", "Jung San: Understanding Beyond Words Part 2"], ["start_time", "2015-05-07 17:30:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-22 22:47:25.859916"], ["venue", "Sandra Lee Gallery"]]

The educator is a classically trained pianist who plays Beethoven for fun. The doctor and the Realtor grew up together and played in ska, funk, and dance bands back in the late &#39;80s. All four have been playing music for fun, for meditation, and because it feeds their soul.  They brought all of this kinetic and eclectic energy together to form Home, a San Francisco based funk/blues/rock/jam/jazzy band. Drawing on influences from the Allman Brothers, Stevie Wonder, Hendrix, Duke Ellington, James Brown, Phish, the Beatles, Curtis Mayfield, George Clinton, Miles Davis, and many others, Home is a band cut from the unique cultural cloth of San Francisco’s music scene. This four piece band with Mark Cambell on guitar and vocals, Mark Isero on keyboard, Peter Coopersmith on drums and vocals, and Jonathan Dearman on bass and vocals is a testament to what happens when love and respect of music come together.

Gallery will open from 11AM to 5PM in East Mall, San Francisco Japantown Register to attend free workshop with Lenneth and Muze from 3pm-4pm (seats limited to 20)       LennethXVII is a cosplayer from Singapore, who is currently residing in California.  She was introduced to cosplay by a classmate when she was 14, and within a year she knew she would have to try it for herself!  Lenneth first dipped her toes into cosplay with Jrock, eventually moving on to videogames and anime/manga.  She prefers to cosplay taller characters, as they&#39;re closer to her size and she feels more sympathy toward older characters in general.  Of the many costumes she&#39;s created over the years, she takes particular pride in Code Geass&#39;s Kururugi Suzaku (Knight of Zero, CLAMP illustration), Kill la Kill&#39;s Ragyo, and Drakengard 3&#39;s Zero.  Even so, she keeps coming back to KOS-MOS from Xenosaga as a skill-testing costume of passion.  In addition to top-notch cosplay and location shoots, Lenneth&#39;s fans and followers on social media are treated with photos of Mako, her golden retriever partner in crime. While MUZE began cosplay and photography in 2007, it was not until 2013 that he fully followed his passion as a cosplay photographer.  His photos tell a story through imagery, creating atmospheres that draw on a wide range of influences including &quot;Kara no Kyokai,&quot; Zhang Jingna, and Brooke Shaden.  Of his own works, he is especially proud of his &quot;Zankyou no Terror&quot; set, which allowed him to tackle an emotional series with the full range of his recently developed skills.  His most technically challenging shoot involved capturing the ethereal light show that is Ragyo Kiryuin from the visually complex anime &quot;Kill la Kill.&quot;  His advice to aspiring photographers is to, &quot;Always try new things and challenge yourself.&quot;  To help with that, he recommends Joe Mcnally&#39;s &quot;Sketching light&quot; as a great book on the logic behind light setup, and suggests you check out James Gurne&#39;s blog on painting/rendering.

Kevin McCormack, Director of Communications and Patient Advocate Outreach at CIRM. Janet Hsu, Senior Director of Corporate Compliance & Ethics at BioMarin. Meghan McKenzie, Senior Clinical Program Leader at Genentech. Bruno Gagnon, Executive Consultant and Former Clinical Operations Leader at Roche, BioMarin, and FibroGen will moderate the panel. Abstract: As both the means and the ultimate motivation of clinical development, patients are the most fundamental assets during the clinical trial process. Patient enrollment, empowerment, engagement, and retention are often identified as the keys to a successful clinical studies. We believe patients are also a key driver of change in shaping tomorrow’s clinical trials. Social media. Smartphones. Biosensors. ePRO. New technology is quickly reshaping our relationship to patients as well as how clinical trials are conducted. New data collection, exchange, or processing technologies are placing the patient at the heart of what clinical trials will look like in the future. Science itself is also changing the game. The revolution of personalized medicine, gene therapies, or regenerative medicine is encouraging the upstart of smaller clinical trials and thus an increased importance to individuals in clinical development. Finding patients, adapting study design and protocols to these type of studies are increasing challenges. Our panel of experts will discuss the changes at play in the role of patients in clinical trials, and discuss scenarii in what the “patient experience” will be in tomorrow’s clinical trials.   More info and registration on www.prcclinical.com/clinpulse "], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s3.evcdn.com/images/block250/I0-001/020/159/958-6.jpeg_/new-patient-experience-tomorrows-clinical-trials-58.jpeg"], ["name", "What is The New Patient Experience in Tomorrow's Clinical Trials?"], ["start_time", "2015-07-22 18:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-22 22:47:32.961332"], ["venue", "Genentech Bldg 82"]]

You swipe to open the app - five of the latest tweets from everybody in the coworking space: a few new articles they retweeted, an Instagram photo from Jessica’s last trip to Tahoe, news about the deal that Dave from upstairs just closed with his largest client since December #success.  Pumping personality into space is Murmur’s mission. To do it, co-founders Eugene Joseph and Adam Becker began by building an app that allows you to see the tweets of everybody within Bluetooth range. An entirely new way of keeping updated with what people around you are interested in and a new way to engage with them. Our short term goal is to cover up Berkeley with a large Bluetooth cloud, where people’s tweets are liberated and roam free, where specific content hovers around specific locations. We’re out to build three types of Bluetooth nests in Berkeley - places where you’re sure to find these murmurs: schools, stores and coworking spaces. All three have the right conditions: they are dense, stationary, and ripe with information. Coworking spaces like Sandbox Suites, we believe, are ideal environments for murmurs to thrive. Busy teams don’t often have the time to keep in touch with all of the other teams in the coworking space, but many of the teams already use Twitter - so all they have to do is plug into the Murmur app. On July 8th, we’ll be coming to present our product during the Lunch and Learn, talk about our development, and paint our vision for the role of Sandbox. Mark your calendars- you don’t want to miss this one.You can learn more about us at www.getonmurmur.com and download Murmur at apple.co/1EJm1V9.

With our high coach to camper ratio, we ensure that every player is directly supervised, every player will receive direct instruction, and every player will get the proper individual attention they need. Our philosophy at BBA is that every player can play high school baseball or beyond with the right attitude, right coaching, and right practice. Through a focus on fundamentals and highly competitive games and activities, we specialize in making our campers play better baseball. BBA camps focus on the key fundamentals of throwing, catching, pitching, hitting, bunting, baserunning, sliding, and fielding. We constantly stress a good attitude, sportsmanship, hustle, and hard work because those are lasting traits both on and off the field. We know that players who are better teammates and love to learn from their coaches will go further than those who don&#39;t. You can expect that your son will improve their skills while attending Bronco Baseball Academy. You can also expect that they will learn to compete harder, love the game more, be a better teammate, be more respectful to their coaches and learn to further honor the great game of baseball. At BBA we encourage every camper to become their own coach, to develop their leadership skills, to be a better friend and student, to be a healthier person, and to become a true student of the game. We provide rewards for watching college and pro baseball games in the evenings and reading the sports page in the mornings. We ask trivia about the history of the game and we want all players to end the week by agreeing with us that baseball is the greatest game on earth."], ["end_time", "2015-06-19 22:00:00.000000"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s1.evcdn.com/store/skin/no_image/categories/128x128/other.jpg"], ["name", "Summer Camp #1 - Bronco Baseball Academy"], ["start_time", "2015-06-15 19:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-22 22:47:34.544731"], ["venue", "Foothill Middle School"]]

New this year, whether you have a passion for Mechoui, Paella, Hotdogs or cold Rose, you can help us by sponsoring your favorite food or beverage. As you may know, we use the BBQ as a fundraiser to support the Lycee but providing great food at a reasonable price while maximizing our donation is tricky business.

The series, comprised of photographic prints on canvas, focus on the much-revered Marin landmark China Camp State Park as its muse. The opening reception will feature refreshments, live music, an introduction by the artist as well as a presentation by a representative from Friends of China Camp.<br><br>20% of sales from each artwork will be donated to Friends of China Camp.<br><br>About Osher Levi<br>My journey into photography began on 1985, in my birth place of Israel, when my father, who recognized my passion for photography, gave me my first 35mm Zenith camera. In my home town of Be&#39;er Sheva we had one printing shop that had their printing machine at the window. I remember standing outside waiting for my prints to be printed, and it gave me so much joy seeing my prints coming out of the machine. Currently, I live in Marin County, California, am married, and have a sweet boy who runs away every time he sees a camera pointing at him.<br><br>About China Camp<br>China Camp has long since provided visitors with unsurpassed hiking and mountain biking trails, scenic vistas, salt marshes, wildlife, and meadows and rugged open spaces. Its designation as a state park was established in 1976, due, in large part, to the efforts of the founding members of the nonprofit organization, Friends of China Camp. In an early Environmental Impact Report written in 1974 by Bob Young, a Marin Conservation League volunteer at the time, China Camp is described as &quot;the last place in the entire Bay Area where an unimpaired natural landscape stretches from Bay shore to mountain top.&quot; <br><br>This exhibit is co-sponsored by the Osher Marin JCC and Leib Ostrow. In partnership with Friends of China Camp and the Marin Conservation League. <p>\n\nMORE INFO: <br>Website: <a href=\"http://www.marinjcc.org/events/2015/06/24/jewish-life/gallery-reception-china-camp/55905/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.marinjcc.org/events/2015/06/24/jewish-life/gallery-reception-china-camp/55905/</a> <br>Email:   <a href=\"mailto:hsanders@marinjcc.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">hsanders@marinjcc.org</a> <br>Phone:   455-444-8000 \n\nSubmitted by the <a href=\"http://www.fullcalendar.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>FullCalendar Event Promotion Service</strong></a></p>"], ["end_time", "2015-06-24 19:00:00.000000"], ["free", "f"], ["name", "Osher Levi China Camp: A Photographic Journey"], ["start_time", "2015-06-24 17:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-22 22:47:35.863254"], ["venue", "Osher Marin Jewish Community Center"]]

This time we recruited three tech-industry leaders whose work overlaps in meaningful ways with the nonprofits world, either as funders or collaborators. You&#39;ll hear their stories, join the dialogue, and walk away with actionable and insightful information. We believe open dialogue and education is the first step in bridging the gap between technology companies and nonprofits in our community. All three of our Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have both meaningful nonprofit experience and significant business acumen, so this should be an exciting and highly anticipated forum.   Meet the speakers... Roderick Campbell - Moderator CEO and cofounder of CommitChange, America&#39;s fastest growing nonprofit software company. Funded by Mark Cuban and Tim Draper. Featured in Forbes, Nonprofit Quarterly, and Fundraising Success magazine. Michael White - ActOn and SV2 VP at National Semiconductor for 12 years. Partner and board member at Silicon Valley Social Venture Fund. Experienced in venture capital. Now launching ActOn, a social venture that connects supporters with causes. Eric Facas - Media Cause After spending 4 years developing Google&#39;s advertising platform, Eric founded Media Cause which now has a reputation as one of the world&#39;s leading nonprofit marketing and development agencies.   You&#39;ll learn about... Ways to steward relationships inside tech companies, emerging technologies that will impact your work, innovative fundraising strategies, the successes and failures of funding models, and lots more.

The campaign “Slow and Say Hello!” will coincide with National Trails Day, the country’s largest celebration of trails with events in every state, on SATURDAY, JUNE 6th.  \nTRAIL PARTNERS’ campaign launch will take place at five locations around Marin County where land managers will host fun outdoor activities for everyone to enjoy and to learn more about trail safety.  http://www.safetrailsmarin.org\n\n“We’ve reached a critical juncture in how we share the many beautiful trails here in Marin County,” said Curt Kruger, of the Marin Horse Council. “With Trail Partners, we hope to  reinforce the desire most of us share to enjoy a safe experience in nature while protecting that resource. Most people will do the right thing if they know what that is, and the various user groups have more in common than differences. Our approach is a positive message focused on education and awareness. We want to create a paradigm shift in how all the different trail users interact, and how we can work together to protect our public lands and make the trails safe for everyone.”  \n\nIn a historic demonstration of support, four local land managers or their supporting associations representing federal, state, county, and the local water district, have contributed funds to support Trail Partners’ county-wide efforts to promote safe trail use and resource protection in Marin County. These land managers include Golden Gate National Recreation Area ($5000), Marin County Parks and Open Space ($5,000), CA State Parks ($5,000) and Marin Municipal Water District ($5,000). \n\nTrail Partners will be launching its Slow and Say Hello! trail etiquette campaign at the following National Trails Day activities on SATURDAY, JUNE 6TH:  \n\nMarin Municipal Water District (MMWD) \nLocation: Shadyside and Berry Trails (park at Lake Lagunitas)\nProject: Help build a redwood trail bridge \nHours: 9:00 am - 1:00 pm \nRSVP: http://ggnpc.convio.net/site/Calendar?id=113424&view=RSVP&_ga=1.252985231.781593112.1420489156 \n\nGGNRA/Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy \nLocation: Coastal Trail at Bolinas Ridge \nProject: Remove overgrown vegetation and tripping hazards from the trail surface \nHours: 10:00 am - 1:30 pm \nRSVP: http://ggnpc.convio.net/site/Calendar?id=113425&view=RSVP&_ga=1.10090547.781593112.1420489156 \n\nMarin County Open Space \nLocation: White Hill Trail near Brown Bridge off Sir Francis Drake Blvd \nProject: Trail work and broom pull \nHours: 9:00 am - 1:00 pm \nRSVP:  http://ggnpc.convio.net/site/Calendar?id=113521&view=RSVP&_ga=1.17120191.781593112.1420489156 \n\nPoint Reyes National Seashore\nLocation: Estero Trail\nProject: Build ranch fencing to prevent trail erosion and ocean sedimentation\nHours: 9:30 am - 3:00 pm\nRSVP: http://www.ptreyes.org/events/trails-oceans-stewardship-day-0 \nor email volunteer@ptreyes.org  \n\nMount Tamalpais State Park\nLocation: TBD \nProject: TBD \nHours: TBD \nRSVP: TBD \n\n50% of Marin County is parkland and open space, containing 600 miles of roads and trails.

The group’s mission is to create a county-wide program in Marin that will engage all trail users in the safe and responsible use of trails.\nLast year, TRAIL PARTNERS began its ongoing program of educational workshops Tails & Tires for cyclists and equestrians of all ages with the goal of educating people on the responsible use of trails and resource protection and to help shift the culture of trail users to one that is mutually aligned and cooperative."], ["end_time", "2015-06-06 13:00:00.000000"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s1.evcdn.com/store/skin/no_image/categories/128x128/other.jpg"], ["name", "Slow and Say Hello!"], ["start_time", "2015-06-06 09:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-22 22:47:38.773541"], ["venue", "Bon Tempe Lake"]]

The amazing traditional Louisiana Cajun duo Jesse Lége & Joel Savoy (www.jesseandjoel.com) return for a night of authentic, acoustic Cajun dance music, expanded to a quartet they call Cajun Country Revival. They’ll play traditional dance hall music along with some of Lége’s own tunes that have become a part of the Cajun repertoire. Joining in are two members of the powerhouse Foghorn Stringband: upright bassist and singer Nadine Landry, and singer-fiddler-banjo player Sammy Lind, just returned from Foghorn’s tour of Ireland and the United Kingdom. Savoy predicts: “Gonna be a fun night!” Jesse Lége defines traditional Louisiana dance hall music. Growing up in a rural, pre-electricity home in Gueydan, Louisiana, Jesse spoke Cajun French and learned music from relatives, neighbors, and the family’s much-loved battery-powered radio. His unmistakable, hard-driving style of accordion playing and his powerful voice get even the most staid listeners up on the dance floor. Lége has been honored with nearly every Cajun music award extant, including induction into the Cajun Music Hall of Fame in 1998. www.jesselege.org According to Linda Ronstadt, “Joel Savoy is one of my favorite musicians on just about any instrument, but on guitar and Cajun fiddle he is truly outstanding.” Joel Savoy, son of Cajun music royalty Marc and Ann Savoy, is one of the most requested fiddlers in Southwest Louisiana today. Growing up in Eunice, Louisiana, at the feet of most of the living masters, he experienced a strong sense of what makes Cajun “Cajun”; as a result, he has developed a fiddle style that is at once authentic and on the cutting edge. In 2006 Savoy launched Valcour Records, which has garnered one Grammy Award (for the Savoy-produced all-star “The Band Courtboullion” CD in 2013) and nine Grammy nominations to date. www.joelsavoy.com "], ["free", "f"], ["image", "http://s4.evcdn.com/images/block250/I0-001/019/508/643-7.jpeg_/jesse-lge-joel-savoy-cajun-country-revival-43.jpeg"], ["name", "Jesse Lége, Joel Savoy & the Cajun Country Revival"], ["performer", "Joel Savoy"], ["start_time", "2015-06-23 20:30:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-23 23:18:57.290909"], ["venue", "Ashkenaz"]]

No matter the tragedies at the center of the songs, in most cases those characters come off like just that – characters; inventions of either a particularly gifted songwriter looking to spin a tall tale or a lazy one looking to pad out an album. But in the case of Whitey Morgan, those characters – the drinker, the troublemaker, the struggling, hard-working man – all seem arrestingly real. That&#39;s largely because the stories on Sonic Ranch -- a big, nasty, whiskey-slugging, bare-knuckle bruiser of a country record – are pulled from Morgan&#39;s own back pages.

Produced by a group of theatrical and outdoor event professionals, the annual fest is equal parts Mardi Gras, state fair, living history, and Pegged-leg eye-patch-wearin’  fan fest that appeals to children and adults alike. With four stages of continuous entertainment, rows of nautically inspired handcrafts, gourmet foods, micro-brewed beers, and ship to shore canon battles, visitors will encounter proper British Naval Officers to alluring mythical mermaids throughout the streets. Our mission is to entertain and engage any one with a love of pirates and all are encouraged to join in the fun by donning a costume. Early Bird ticket sales begin on March 27th 2015 and end April 17th, 2015. Returning Plank Owners will recieve a renewal notice on March 27th. 2015 Plank Owner Tickets go on sale April 17th 2015. A “plank owner” is an individual who was a member of the crew of a ship when that ship was placed in commission. Originally, this term applied only to crew members present at the ship’s first commissioning. The origin of the term is the implication that a crew member was around when the ship was being built and commissioned and therefore has bragging rights to the ownership of one of the deck planks in the main deck. The Plank Owners of the Northern California Pirate Festival get special privileges and perks that normal attendees do not! Online Ticket sales End June 19th at 6pm. Ticket sales will resume onsite on June 20th and 21st beginning at 9 am.  This event is not a pet friendly event. No animals allowed. Please peace tie your weapons by using a cord and securing the weapon shut and to your body. No live munitions or working firearms.   FAQs  Are there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event? You will not be required to show your ID at the gate for admission. It is advisable to have identification on you in case there is an issue that you would like us to resolve. The Northern California Pirate Festival is an all ages event, however the Buccaneers Bash is a bit more salty and so we do not admit anyone under 18 without a parent present. What are my transport/parking options getting to the event? The NCPF takes place along the waterfront in Vallejo California. The Ferry Terminal to and from San Francisco is located next door to the event. Please check Vallejo Ferry schedules before planning your trip.   Vallejo has been upgrading the parking around the ferry terminal and there is a great deal of paid parking near the event site. If you fancy a walk and free parking you can find street parking around Vallejo if you get to the site early. What is Parking like? There is limited street parking available at no cost and city lot parking available for a daily fee. Go to the city parking information page for more information. What can/can&#39;t I bring to the event? This event is not pet friendly. The crowds are large and the guns are loud. The sun is also powerful and cars can heat up very quickly. Please leave your animals at home. Please peace tie your weapons by using a cord and securing the weapon shut and to your body. No live munitions or working firearms.  Where can I contact the organizer with any questions? Please contact Kathy Kingman with any ticketing related questions: Kathy@praetorianusa.com Any other festival related questions may be directed to info@norcalpiratefestival.com  Is my ticket transferrable? You may give away any unused ticket before the event but you may not transfer the ticket once it is in use (example: two day wristbands are only good for one person.) Plank Owner Club Passes and VIP Passes are non-transferrable.  Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event? You may either print your ticket or download your ticket to your smart device. You must have a ticket in one of those formats in order to enter. This year we will be working with satellite ticket offices in order to promote traffic to local non- profits. You will be given a ticket at the time of the transaction. Please bring it with you to the event. Satellite locations will be promoted on the website after the early bird sales are over. There are no replacements for lost tickets. What is the refund policy? The NCPF has a no refund policy. This event is rain or shine. You may upgrade a ticket that has not been used (example, you bought a weekend pass and would like to go to the Buccanners bash. Pay the extra bit and we will upgrade your pass)  The name on the registration/ticket doesn&#39;t match the attendee. Is that okay? If your name does not match the name on the account that the ticket was purchased under you will not be able to address any issue should one arise. Only the person who bought the ticket can change anything on the account. However, anyone can enter with a valid ticket. Does the Plank Owner Membership include admission? Yes. The plank owner membership comes with one premium pass for each member. Once you purchase your membership you will receive a code that will allow you a discount off a one day admissio for your crew. Your membership also allows you to bring a friend and two children into the VIP area with you. I purchased a plank in a previous year but did not get a discount code. What should I do? Your active membership will always be renewed at the price you originally paid for it. You must renew every year in order to keep your membership active. You are allowed a one year grace period to keep your membership active-however if you miss more than one year of renewals you will have to purchase a new membership at the current price. If you are an active member and you have not recieved a code, go to www.plankowners club.com and find the link that allows you to update your email address. What should I be paying for a Plank Membership? Charter Members renew at $50. Charter members originally purchased thier Planks in 2007. Foundation Members renew at $70 and became members during the years between 2008 and 2012. Alliance members are new members and 2013 and 2014 members who renew at the current rate of $95. By March 27, 2015 all Charter and Foundation members should have recieved an email with thier personalized code to renew and buy discount tickets. Alliance members will need to renew thier membership in order to recieve a code for the discount day tickets. There is no online discount for premium and weekend passes because the online discount is deeper than the plank discount for both passes. At the Gate you will receive your Plank Owner discount. If you are ordering past the deadline of June 5, 2015 you are not guaranteed a t-shirt. We will have a limited supply of them at the event but they are first come first served. We will also have a supply of plank owner totes available should you not find a shirt in your size. Be sure to print your receipt!

WINC helps women, especially artists, healers and creative types, get super focused on driving their revenue up, within an intimate and collaborative culture of women doing it together. Myka teachers a simple, but highly strategic four-part system called, The Engine of Your Business Revenue, that builds a powerful focus in the four areas of a woman’s business that actually generates money. Myka discovered this system when she too struggled to turn her passion into profit. Once she cracked this code, she went from not making any money into a fully profitable business in 6 weeks, and a six-figure business in 9 months, with continued growth since. She has worked with over 100 women in WINC’s three-month Program.<br> Myka graduated with distinction from the University of Colorado with a degree in Economics and International Affairs, and has been self-employed since she was fifteen years old.<p><strong>Testimonials</strong><p> <em>In the first and second month of the Program I hit my revenue goals, and in the third month, I made double my revenue goal!</em> ~ Reilly Jernigan, Massage Therapist / Acupuncturist<p> <em>This Program is by far THE BEST decision I have ever made for the health of my business.

In 1983 Jane moved from the UK to the US with just a suitcase, beauty school diploma and boyfriend. Jane and her boyfriend-turned-husband, Raymond, founded the International Dermal institute the same year, which now educates more than 75,000 skin therapists every year and can be found in 14 locations around the world. And this is just the prequel to Jane’s entrepreneurial tale; she went on to found cult skincare brand Dermalogica in 1986. Her business model is a bit unheard of. For starters, she has never taken a bank loan and Dermalogica has remained a privately owned company despite its mammoth size. Today, Dermalogica products are loved for everything they don’t contain (harsh irritants, fragrances) and are the number-one choice of more than 100,000 professional skin therapists; they can be found in more than 80 countries worldwide and have 50 offices. Since 2010, Jane has been a member of the Clinton Global Initiative, and is part of their Women and Girls Action Committee – and, in 2011, she founded FITE (Financial Independence Through Entrepreneurship), an initiative that helps women, especially in developing countries, fulfil their entrepreneurial dreams. And FITE has already helped more than 50,000 women in 68 countries start or grow their own businesses. This breakfast with Jane will be the perfect way to reward your clients and staff – or come on your own and meet a whole lot of other Business Chicks! You’ll walk away inspired and ready for more.

Schlesinger will lead participants through the nuances of his own process and craft, including his specific interest in the ethics of making, and how joinery can be seen as a material metaphor for &quot;being together&quot;.

The three-day event runs Friday - Sunday, April 10-12 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day on West Portal Avenue between 15th and Ulloa.<br><br>Local residents and tourists alike flock to admire the works of more than 40 artists displaying everything from photography, paintings, ceramics, jewelry and much more. The show is free to the public and is presented by the West Portal Avenue Association. Among the featured artists at this year&#39;s show:<br><br>Jennifer Clifford<br>Studio: San Francisco <br>Medium: Mixed Media<br>Art: Drawing inspiration from the beautiful San Francisco Bay, Jennifer creates whimsical collage and screen print art.<br>Creative Process: Jennifer&#39;s collage work incorporates media from variety of paper materials, including wallpaper, old ticket stubs, Muni and BART passes, maps, newsprint, rice paper, and vintage magazines. Vibrant offbeat fabrics are also found in her collages, some of which are repurposed clothes. Her screen print work is created from her photography. She prints on fabric and/or wallpaper and mounts each print to a wood panel. She describes her approach to design as textural, colorful, resourceful, imperfect, and eclectic.<br><br>John Osterhaug<br>Studio: San Francisco <br>Medium: Glass<br>Art: Jewelry<br>Creative Process: Since the 1980s, John has made glass jewelry, including cufflinks for men, by creating bright and reflective, almost neon color on fused glass with oxidizing metals, which he kiln fires. John creates all of his work from start to finish. He begins the process by cutting, sanding, drilling and kiln-firing multi-colored pieces of glass and then crafts them into earrings, pendants, rings, necklaces and bracelets. &quot;The method that I use to create my jewelry results in a unique set of work exhibiting a luminescent quality that glistens and glows as you move it,&quot; said John.<br><br>Locke Heemstra<br>Studio: San Mateo<br>Medium: Giclée photographic prints, which are individually produced, high-resolution prints made using a sophisticated wide format inkjet printer technology. <br>Art: Locke&#39;s photographic images are printed on large canvas, then cut to size and stretched over 1-1/4&quot; stretcher bars. The 1-1/4 inch edges of the photographic canvases have a unique artistic appearance as the image continues to fold around the sides to the back, eliminating the need for frames or glass.<br>Creative Process: Locke&#39;s early images focused on the natural wonders of the United States, from the rich fall foliage of New England to the vivid blues and greens of the California coast. In time, he began to concentrate on natural and manmade settings lush with color. The public&#39;s enthusiastic response to the vibrant colors in his work convinced Locke he was on the right path. Next, he decided to combine his love of European culture with his new approach to color. Today, Locke travels to Europe at least three times a year, always searching for that special image that will give the viewer a sense of place. <br><br>For more information about the West Portal Avenue Sidewalk Arts and Crafts Fair contact the West Portal Avenue Association at (415) 566-3500 or Pacific Fine Arts Festivals at (209) 267-4394 or visit <a href=\"http://www.pacificfinearts.com/\" rel=\"nowfollow\" rel=\"nowfollow\" rel=\"nowfollow\">http://www.pacificfinearts.com</a> on Facebook at <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/PacificFineArts\" rel=\"nowfollow\" rel=\"nowfollow\" rel=\"nowfollow\">http://www.facebook.com/PacificFineArts</a> and Twitter @PacificFineArts"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgs\#{c}\#{[1,2,3].sample}.jpg"], ["name", "West Portal Sidewalk Fine Arts & Crafts Fair"], ["start_time", "2015-04-11 00:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:21:46.876754"], ["venue", "West Portal Ave Association"]]

If you are looking for the answer to these questions, you will certainly benefit from attending this seminar on preparing for FDA inspections:   • Do you worry about an upcoming FDA inspection?   • Do you know how you should behave during the inspection?   • Do you know what an end to end FDA inspection process looks like?   • Do you know what an FDA investigator(s) will look for?   • Do you know how to proactively assess and mitigate FDA compliance risks?   • Do you know what information you should get ready ahead of an FDA inspection?   • Does your organization have a game plan for managing an FDA inspection?   • Does your organization know how to respond to and manage FDA observations (483s), or warning letters?     The FDA inspection is one of the critical measures of your quality system and your organization as a whole. Since a perfect quality system is usually not implemented, the preparation for and management of an FDA inspection is critically important. A well-established quality system provides a solid foundation for passing FDA inspections; however, if you don’t proactively examine your quality system from the perspective of a FDA inspector, you can still have difficulties. A less than perfect quality system has the potential to attract FDA observations, but if you prepare, proactively identify and mitigate the compliance risks, you can still achieve good inspection results and avoid or minimize negative impact on your business. Based on extensive experience of both managing inspections from the industry side and conducting inspections from FDA side, this seminar will share insights about FDA inspections and provide a set of comprehensive strategies and instructions on how to prepare for and manage an FDA inspection, including how to follow-up and closing out 483s or Warning Letters.     By attending this seminar on preparing for FDA inspection, participants will learn:   • Background about FDA inspection program.   • How to proactively assess quality system readiness for FDA inspection.   • How to identify compliance risks.   • How to proactively mitigate before, during and after the inspection.   • How to respond to 483s and warning letters including templates based on industry best practices.  Additionally attendees will be provided with:  • Toolkit on how to assess a quality system’s readiness, and identify and mitigate potential compliance risks.   • A checklist of information that should be prepared prior to inspection.   • A strategy template on how to manage a FDA inspection (front room, back room, role playing, dos and don’ts, etc.).  Toolkit on how to prepare responses to 483 observations and warning letters.     Course Objectives:   • To provide an overview of the FDA inspection program and key success factors for a manufacturer.  • To introduce the best practices on how to manage inspections including a template of game plan.   • To introduce the industry best practices on what information should be prepared ahead of inspection including a checklist.  • To introduce the best practices including templates on how to respond to and closeout FDA 483s and warning letters.   • To introduce the best practices and toolkit on how to assess readiness for a FDA inspection, and how to proactively identify and mitigate compliance risks.    Who will Benefit:   This course will provide valuable assistance and guidance to all regulated companies that are preparing for FDA inspections. The following job titles/ positions will benefit from attending this seminar:   • Quality Engineers   • Managers   • Directors   • VPs, Regulatory Affairs   • Auditors   • Risk Managers   • Compliance Officers   • Management Representatives   • Management with Executive Responsibilities   • Members of Senior Management Team   • Validation Managers "], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgs\#{c}\#{[1,2,3].sample}.jpg"], ["name", "How to Prepare for, Manage, and Follow-up to an FDA Inspection: Risk-driven Approach 2 day In-Person Seminar"], ["start_time", "2015-06-18 08:30:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:21:53.049996"], ["venue", "Hilton"]]

With our high coach to camper ratio, we ensure that every player is directly supervised, every player will receive direct instruction, and every player will get the proper individual attention they need. Our philosophy at BBA is that every player can play high school baseball or beyond with the right attitude, right coaching, and right practice. Through a focus on fundamentals and highly competitive games and activities, we specialize in making our campers play better baseball. BBA camps focus on the key fundamentals of throwing, catching, pitching, hitting, bunting, baserunning, sliding, and fielding. We constantly stress a good attitude, sportsmanship, hustle, and hard work because those are lasting traits both on and off the field. We know that players who are better teammates and love to learn from their coaches will go further than those who don&#39;t. You can expect that your son will improve their skills while attending Bronco Baseball Academy. You can also expect that they will learn to compete harder, love the game more, be a better teammate, be more respectful to their coaches and learn to further honor the great game of baseball. At BBA we encourage every camper to become their own coach, to develop their leadership skills, to be a better friend and student, to be a healthier person, and to become a true student of the game. We provide rewards for watching college and pro baseball games in the evenings and reading the sports page in the mornings. We ask trivia about the history of the game and we want all players to end the week by agreeing with us that baseball is the greatest game on earth."], ["end_time", "2015-07-10 15:00:00.000000"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgs\#{c}\#{[1,2,3].sample}.jpg"], ["name", "Summer Camp #3 - Bronco Baseball Academy"], ["start_time", "2015-07-06 09:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:21:54.658775"], ["venue", "Foothill Middle School"]]

It&#39;s the third WNBR of the year. \n\nIt is time for the Twelfth Annual World Naked Bike Ride - San Francisco Northern Hemisphere Edition, Part I. \n\nNormally we meet on the northeast side of Vaillancourt Fountain, between the fountain and Embarcadero Blvd. However an issue regarding Permits and the National Park Police has brought about the need for an alternate meeting spot. This spot is across the street from our usual Justin Herman location in an open public area to the north and between the Farmer&#39;s Market and the Starbuck&#39;s. It is visible to our old meeting spot. So look for us across from Justin Herman on Embarcadero and just northwest of the Ferry building. We will begin meeting there at 11:00 AM.Please remained dressed until we have sufficient numbers of riders and are near the time we will ride.\n\nWe will have time to do body/face paint and reacquaint ourselves with old friends. Bring body paints, watercolors and markers to apply slogans and designs to each other and adorn your bikes with signs; meet with old and new friends. Our ride typically begins just a bit after the Noon hour.\n\nWhile it is a &quot;naked&quot; bike ride, all are welcome; it&#39;s ride as bare as you dare. That is, body paint, rubber latex, bikinis, topless, lingerie, bubble pack, whatever costume you are comfortable riding with. And we have already had several WNBRs while under cloud of the oppressive anti-nudity ordinance, with NO citations or complaints. If you are still uncertain, than its best to have a sarong, a beach wrap or shorts ready for quick coverup. \n\nAs always, our ride is in continued protest of an unsustainable energy policy in all nations around the globe. We support the innovation of alternate and improved energy technologies, the social commitment to a more sustainable energy consumption and generally the pure fun and joy of riding naked to draw attention to these issues. \n\nYou decide how much bare you can dare, you can go all out in the joy of sun clad nakedness, go topless, bikinis, body paint or latex, leotard or lingerie, or tuxedos, whatever you feel like. \n\nSkates or skateboards have ridden along with us in the past. Also we had our first tandem bike in a recent ride. We&#39;ve had a nude unicyclist? And music maestro please. How about some of you musical bikes from Rock The Bike sounding off with us?\n\nOur route will take us through our usual favorite areas along Fisherman&#39;s Wharf, The Marina, North Beach, The Haight, Ocean Beach if the weather is summer-like hot, and past AT&T Park on the Embarcadero. The route will be published just before the ride.\n\nTell all your friends and hope to see you bare."], ["end_time", "2015-06-13 16:30:00.000000"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgs\#{c}\#{[1,2,3].sample}.jpg"], ["name", "12th Annual World Naked Bike Ride - San Francisco Northern Hemisphere Edition, Part I"], ["start_time", "2015-06-13 11:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:21:58.904229"], ["venue", "Ferry Building Marketplace"]]

But, similar to other essential-to life-but-seldom-formally-taught life skills (i.e. how to raise a child), we rarely encounter a formal, rigorous program for how to navigate race & power dynamics in our professional lives. For many professionals, the preamble to grappling with inequality frequently stems from 1) familial-communal acumen, 2) ethnic studies/-ism-centered college courses, & 3) individual study/practice/living. Racial Equitecture seeks to build upon this knowledge, offering a methodical praxis that uses research and experience to coach professionals to navigate racial events in ways that safeguard mind-body-spirit balance and productivity.

Things that would have been chaotic to my entire being before, I can now see in a different lens...Dr. McAfee has opened my eyes to another method of engagement with my work.”- L.

I now have a language...” - P.R., program manager\n\n“This has been the best conversation we’ve had on race.” - N.M., nonprofit director\n\nSkill/Knowledge Goals:\n\n\nParticipants will be able to:\n\n1) Create racial climates where racial microaggressions, invalidations, and insults have less of an impact.\n\n2) Sense rhetorical, emotional, and egoistic postures used to assert power & ways to navigate them in the moment.\n\n3) Practice and strengthen their response-ability to racial events in their professional/personal lives.\n\n\nExperiential Goals:\n\nMy goal is for you to step beyond what you imagine is possible.  To be brave and do something you&#39;ve never done before.  This goal is supported by a pedagogical approach that lies at the nexus of critical race pedagogy, black feminist thought, adaptive leadership, and experiential learning.  This means there will be little lecturing, lots of practice, dwelling in negative capability, productive discomfort, and constructive feedback.  You will be guided to drive discussions rather than silently receive. The intention is to create a holding environment for rehearsing courage while personally developing a racial response-ability that better addresses racial events in our world.\n\nRegister at: https://strengthenracialresponse-ability.eventbrite.com.

Take the edge off with cheap drinks and free laughs as these choleric comics direct their disdain towards all of society’s growing ills.\n\nJune’s lineup features maladjusted mirth makers David Gborie (Bridgetown Comedy Fest), James Fluty (Hand to Mouth), Jesse Elias (Outside Lands), Karinda Dobbins (Punch Line), Jon Schabl (Write Now! on Nerdist Network), Christopher John (Cobb’s) and Land Smith (Talkies) with special guests Sad Vicious (comedy/music/madness). Hosted by Trevor Hill (Hand to Mouth).\n\nEvery First Monday of the Month!\n\nThe Rite Spot is a cozy Mission dive that features local bands, comedians and performers. A rare San Francisco luxury set in an unpretentious atmosphere featuring Italian-American food, a full bar and an excellent wine list. “Aside from a little low conversation and the occasional clink of a glass, people are there to listen, and what they’re listening to is top-notch.” -SF Weekly\n\nhttp://miseryindexsf.tumblr.com"], ["end_time", "2015-07-06 21:30:00.000000"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgs food 3.jpg"], ["name", "MISERY INDEX - Free Comedy & Cheap Drinks"], ["start_time", "2015-07-06 20:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:24:42.237347"], ["venue", "Rite Spot Cafe"]]

The origin of the term is the implication that a crew member was around when the ship was being built and commissioned and therefore has bragging rights to the ownership of one of the deck planks in the main deck. <br>The Plank Owners of the Northern California Pirate Festival get special privileges and perks that normal attendees do not!<br>Online Ticket sales End June 19th at 6pm. Ticket sales will resume onsite on June 20th and 21st beginning at 9 am. <p>This event is not a pet friendly event. No animals allowed.<p>Please peace tie your weapons by using a cord and securing the weapon shut and to your body.

It is advisable to have identification on you in case there is an issue that you would like us to resolve. The Northern California Pirate Festival is an all ages event, however the Buccaneers Bash is a bit more salty and so we do not admit anyone under 18 without a parent present.<p><strong>What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?</strong><p>The NCPF takes place along the waterfront in Vallejo California. The Ferry Terminal to and from San Francisco is located next door to the event. Please check Vallejo Ferry schedules before planning your trip.  <p>Vallejo has been upgrading the parking around the ferry terminal and there is a great deal of paid parking near the event site. If you fancy a walk and free parking you can find street parking around Vallejo if you get to the site early.<p><strong>What is Parking like?</strong><p>There is limited street parking available at no cost and city lot parking available for a daily fee. <a href=\"http://www.ci.vallejo.ca.us/cms/one.aspx?objectId=43035\" rel=\"nofollow\">Go to the city parking information page for more information.</a><p><strong>What can/can&#39;t I bring to the event?</strong><p>This event is not pet friendly. The crowds are large and the guns are loud. The sun is also powerful and cars can heat up very quickly. Please leave your animals at home.<p>Please peace tie your weapons by using a cord and securing the weapon shut and to your body. No live munitions or working firearms.<p> <strong>Where can I contact the organizer with any questions?</strong><p>Please contact Kathy Kingman with any ticketing related questions: Kathy@praetorianusa.com<p>Any other festival related questions may be directed to info@norcalpiratefestival.com<p> <strong>Is my ticket transferrable?</strong><p>You may give away any unused ticket before the event but you may not transfer the ticket once it is in use (example: two day wristbands are only good for one person.) Plank Owner Club Passes and VIP Passes are non-transferrable.<p> <strong>Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?</strong><p>You may either print your ticket or download your ticket to your smart device. You must have a ticket in one of those formats in order to enter.<p>This year we will be working with satellite ticket offices in order to promote traffic to local non- profits. You will be given a ticket at the time of the transaction. Please bring it with you to the event. Satellite locations will be promoted on the website after the early bird sales are over. There are no replacements for lost tickets.<p><strong>What is the refund policy?</strong><p>The NCPF has a no refund policy. This event is rain or shine. You may upgrade a ticket that has not been used (example, you bought a weekend pass and would like to go to the Buccanners bash. Pay the extra bit and we will upgrade your pass)<p> <strong>The name on the registration/ticket doesn&#39;t match the attendee. Is that okay?</strong><p>If your name does not match the name on the account that the ticket was purchased under you will not be able to address any issue should one arise. Only the person who bought the ticket can change anything on the account. However, anyone can enter with a valid ticket.<p><strong>Does the Plank Owner Membership include admission?</strong><p>Yes. The plank owner membership comes with one premium pass for each member. Once you purchase your membership you will receive a code that will allow you a discount off a one day admissio for your crew. Your membership also allows you to bring a friend and two children into the VIP area with you.<p><strong>I purchased a plank in a previous year but did not get a discount code. What should I do?</strong><p>Your active membership will always be renewed at the price you originally paid for it. You must renew every year in order to keep your membership active. You are allowed a one year grace period to keep your membership active-however if you miss more than one year of renewals you will have to purchase a new membership at the current price.<br>If you are an active member and you have not recieved a code, go to www.plankowners club.com and find the link that allows you to update your email address. <br><p><strong>What should I be paying for a Plank Membership?</strong><p>Charter Members renew at $50. Charter members originally purchased thier Planks in 2007.<p>Foundation Members renew at $70 and became members during the years between 2008 and 2012.<p>Alliance members are new members and 2013 and 2014 members who renew at the current rate of $95. <p>By March 27, 2015 all Charter and Foundation members should have recieved an email with thier personalized code to renew and buy discount tickets. Alliance members will need to renew thier membership in order to recieve a code for the discount day tickets.<p>There is no online discount for premium and weekend passes because the online discount is deeper than the plank discount for both passes. At the Gate you will receive your Plank Owner discount.<p>If you are ordering past the deadline of June 5, 2015 you are not guaranteed a t-shirt. We will have a limited supply of them at the event but they are first come first served. We will also have a supply of plank owner totes available should you not find a shirt in your size.

Seed Stage Angel investors generally invest $100,000-$200,000 per person in early stage technology companies as compared to traditional Angels who may invest $25,000 to $50,000 in a deal. If you are an entrepreneur in a startup that is currently seeking capital and would like to present your best two-minute (time limit is strictly enforced) elevator pitch to a panel of Angels, you must follow the instructions below. Pitching slots go quickly, so sign up early! To Present a Pitch You must register in advance; presenters are assigned on a first-come basis and slot availability is confirmed automatically during registration; the maximum number of presenters is 10, plus 4 ‘no guarantee’ Standby slots. Once you register additional guidelines will be sent. You must RSVP receipt. Your pitch is two minutes, timing is strictly enforced, no handouts, cards, demos or samples allowed during or immediately after your presentation. Your pitch is followed by 4 minutes of Q&A by the panel; and 4 minutes of non-rebuttal feedback from each panelist. Only one person from the company may present the (2) minute pitch to the investors and answer questions from the panel. Entrepreneurs not yet ready to pitch or unable to reserve a pitch slot are encouraged register and attend.  By listening to the pitches, the Q&A, and the critiques you learn the key points required to develop an effective pitch that investors value. You also have the opportunity to network with investors person to person at the event. If you are an investor, come and listen to the entrepreneurs’ pitches—you never know where you’ll find your next deal. Learn how other investors rate the pitches; which Angels pass and for what reasons; and which entrepreneurs other Angels want to talk to ASAP.   If you are interested in serving on a Pitch or Workshop panel please contact Valerie Badgett, Program Manager.

Developing a mutually beneficial business relationship with the best agent or agency for you is often a crucial step in your successful career. If you are currently seeking representation, or think you might want to at some point in your career, this is an essential event you won’t want to miss. Join APA as these top artists’ agents candidly discuss important topics like: Who should have a rep? What exactly can a rep do for me? What exactly can I do for a rep? What stage in my career is the best time to have representation? How do I get the right rep for me? What kind of promos are effective in attracting a rep? How do I work efficiently with my rep? What are the typical percentages a rep earns? When I first start working with a rep, what will they expect me to do? How will my marketing change when I get a rep? What kinds of new clients can I expect to get? How do I set up a mutually beneficial contract with my rep?

If you are looking for the answer to these questions, you will certainly benefit from attending this seminar on preparing for FDA inspections:   • Do you worry about an upcoming FDA inspection?   • Do you know how you should behave during the inspection?   • Do you know what an end to end FDA inspection process looks like?   • Do you know what an FDA investigator(s) will look for?   • Do you know how to proactively assess and mitigate FDA compliance risks?   • Do you know what information you should get ready ahead of an FDA inspection?   • Does your organization have a game plan for managing an FDA inspection?   • Does your organization know how to respond to and manage FDA observations (483s), or warning letters?     The FDA inspection is one of the critical measures of your quality system and your organization as a whole. Since a perfect quality system is usually not implemented, the preparation for and management of an FDA inspection is critically important. A well-established quality system provides a solid foundation for passing FDA inspections; however, if you don’t proactively examine your quality system from the perspective of a FDA inspector, you can still have difficulties. A less than perfect quality system has the potential to attract FDA observations, but if you prepare, proactively identify and mitigate the compliance risks, you can still achieve good inspection results and avoid or minimize negative impact on your business. Based on extensive experience of both managing inspections from the industry side and conducting inspections from FDA side, this seminar will share insights about FDA inspections and provide a set of comprehensive strategies and instructions on how to prepare for and manage an FDA inspection, including how to follow-up and closing out 483s or Warning Letters.     By attending this seminar on preparing for FDA inspection, participants will learn:   • Background about FDA inspection program.   • How to proactively assess quality system readiness for FDA inspection.   • How to identify compliance risks.   • How to proactively mitigate before, during and after the inspection.   • How to respond to 483s and warning letters including templates based on industry best practices.  Additionally attendees will be provided with:  • Toolkit on how to assess a quality system’s readiness, and identify and mitigate potential compliance risks.   • A checklist of information that should be prepared prior to inspection.   • A strategy template on how to manage a FDA inspection (front room, back room, role playing, dos and don’ts, etc.).  Toolkit on how to prepare responses to 483 observations and warning letters.     Course Objectives:   • To provide an overview of the FDA inspection program and key success factors for a manufacturer.  • To introduce the best practices on how to manage inspections including a template of game plan.   • To introduce the industry best practices on what information should be prepared ahead of inspection including a checklist.  • To introduce the best practices including templates on how to respond to and closeout FDA 483s and warning letters.   • To introduce the best practices and toolkit on how to assess readiness for a FDA inspection, and how to proactively identify and mitigate compliance risks.    Who will Benefit:   This course will provide valuable assistance and guidance to all regulated companies that are preparing for FDA inspections.

We allow one professional per industry, so it’s important we hand-select the right person. They need to be someone who we can work with and pass referrals.

If you’re interested in profitable relationships, helping others and generating qualified referrals — RSVP to this meeting!\n\nMeeting Agenda\nWe understand you’re busy being successful, so our meeting is only 60 minutes and will end on time. Please respect our members by silencing your phone during the meeting. Thank you.\n\nOpen Networking: Grab some coffee and a new friend!\n\nStart Meeting: Take your seat.\nRound Robin: Take 1 minute to tell us about your business. Keep it simple.\nWorkshop: We’ll discuss how to work by referral.\nReferral Focus: Who’s a strong referral partner for you?\nReferral Roulette: Walk away with a 1-2-1 meeting.\nLocation: Enjoy a meal & post a review.\nOrientation: Your next steps to becoming a Referral Partner.\nAnnouncements: Upcoming events.\nClose Meeting: Complete & return visitor questionnaire.\n\nExpectations:\nDress in business attire\nBring Business Cards\nPen & Paper\nBring a Friend\nThere is coffee and water, no food."], ["end_time", "2015-06-25 09:30:00.000000"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgs clubs_associations 1.jpg"], ["name", "San Ramon Networking Event"], ["start_time", "2015-06-25 08:30:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:24:53.113839"], ["venue", "YiPing Restaurant"]]

Schlesinger will lead participants through the nuances of his own process and craft, including his specific interest in the ethics of making, and how joinery can be seen as a material metaphor for &quot;being together&quot;.

The three-day event runs Friday - Sunday, April 10-12 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day on West Portal Avenue between 15th and Ulloa.<br><br>Local residents and tourists alike flock to admire the works of more than 40 artists displaying everything from photography, paintings, ceramics, jewelry and much more. The show is free to the public and is presented by the West Portal Avenue Association. Among the featured artists at this year&#39;s show:<br><br>Jennifer Clifford<br>Studio: San Francisco <br>Medium: Mixed Media<br>Art: Drawing inspiration from the beautiful San Francisco Bay, Jennifer creates whimsical collage and screen print art.<br>Creative Process: Jennifer&#39;s collage work incorporates media from variety of paper materials, including wallpaper, old ticket stubs, Muni and BART passes, maps, newsprint, rice paper, and vintage magazines. Vibrant offbeat fabrics are also found in her collages, some of which are repurposed clothes. Her screen print work is created from her photography. She prints on fabric and/or wallpaper and mounts each print to a wood panel. She describes her approach to design as textural, colorful, resourceful, imperfect, and eclectic.<br><br>John Osterhaug<br>Studio: San Francisco <br>Medium: Glass<br>Art: Jewelry<br>Creative Process: Since the 1980s, John has made glass jewelry, including cufflinks for men, by creating bright and reflective, almost neon color on fused glass with oxidizing metals, which he kiln fires. John creates all of his work from start to finish. He begins the process by cutting, sanding, drilling and kiln-firing multi-colored pieces of glass and then crafts them into earrings, pendants, rings, necklaces and bracelets. &quot;The method that I use to create my jewelry results in a unique set of work exhibiting a luminescent quality that glistens and glows as you move it,&quot; said John.<br><br>Locke Heemstra<br>Studio: San Mateo<br>Medium: Giclée photographic prints, which are individually produced, high-resolution prints made using a sophisticated wide format inkjet printer technology. <br>Art: Locke&#39;s photographic images are printed on large canvas, then cut to size and stretched over 1-1/4&quot; stretcher bars. The 1-1/4 inch edges of the photographic canvases have a unique artistic appearance as the image continues to fold around the sides to the back, eliminating the need for frames or glass.<br>Creative Process: Locke&#39;s early images focused on the natural wonders of the United States, from the rich fall foliage of New England to the vivid blues and greens of the California coast. In time, he began to concentrate on natural and manmade settings lush with color. The public&#39;s enthusiastic response to the vibrant colors in his work convinced Locke he was on the right path. Next, he decided to combine his love of European culture with his new approach to color. Today, Locke travels to Europe at least three times a year, always searching for that special image that will give the viewer a sense of place. <br><br>For more information about the West Portal Avenue Sidewalk Arts and Crafts Fair contact the West Portal Avenue Association at (415) 566-3500 or Pacific Fine Arts Festivals at (209) 267-4394 or visit <a href=\"http://www.pacificfinearts.com/\" rel=\"nowfollow\" rel=\"nowfollow\" rel=\"nowfollow\">http://www.pacificfinearts.com</a> on Facebook at <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/PacificFineArts\" rel=\"nowfollow\" rel=\"nowfollow\" rel=\"nowfollow\">http://www.facebook.com/PacificFineArts</a> and Twitter @PacificFineArts"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgs art 1.jpg"], ["name", "West Portal Sidewalk Fine Arts & Crafts Fair"], ["start_time", "2015-04-11 00:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:24:57.685866"], ["venue", "West Portal Ave Association"]]

Software configuration management (SCM) is a process for facilitating and controlling changes to software products within an organization. This course covers configuration activities such as: configuration planning, change control and management, system building, and version and release management. You learn how the application core processes of SCM contribute to the success of a software project. A software and hardware prototype is used in the case study throughout the course, allowing the concepts of SCM to be applied during workshops and activities. What background do I need? No particular programming language or specific software expertise is assumed. Familiarity with a software development life cycle is helpful. Who will benefit from this course? The course is valuable to software development and maintenance personnel coding or designing systems, systems administrators and those leading software-intensive activities such as business analysts, project leaders and configuration managers. Anyone involved with software development, integration, maintenance, operations, testing, quality assurance or process improvement benefits from this course. Does my whole development team need to attend? While beneficial to entire development teams, providing a foundation for representatives of each group would be a good starting point. It is also not necessary that the entire development team attend at the same time, and onsite options for your company are also available. Please ask your Sales representative if onsite is something of interest to you. Is the course linked to a specific CM approach, programming language or operating system? No. The practical techniques that the course advocates are applicable to mainframes, servers, workstations and personal computers across the spectrum of operating systems. Is the course relevant for all types of programming teams? Yes. This course is beneficial to one person teams as well as teams with large co-located groups as well as geographically dispersed groups. The course approaches the software development life cycle by considering phases in development, not by aligning with one approach or another. SCM applies at the SDLC phase, regardless of the type, size, language, or budget of a programming project. Are SCM techniques effective for projects of varying sizes and complexity? Software expected to have long operational life needs to be maintained and altered over time. It may need to be distributed to multiple locations or modified to run on a different platform. Software in fast-changing Web applications with aggressive, market-drive deadlines also need to be controlled. The control mechanisms built into the software configuration management process ensure that these challenges are understood, controlled and supported. SCM concepts can be applied to any project, regardless of size and complexity. Are there software packages useful for configuration management? If so, will they be demonstrated during the course? Yes. The course focuses on the principles and application of SCM processes, taking a tool-independent approach. When you return to your work environment, the SCM principles built into the various tools of the industry will be evident and will then be able to be properly used according to the software vendor’s implementation. How much time is spent on each topic? Content Hours Foundation for configuration and release management 3.0 Identifying Configuration Items (CIs) 3.0 Controlling change 3.0 Communicating configuration status 2.0 Auditing in preparation for a release 2.0 Deciding on a build strategy 2.0 Developing a release strategy 2.0 Times, including the workshops, are estimates; exact times may vary according to the needs of each class. How much time does the course spend in activities? Approximately 40 percent of this course is spent in activities. Throughout the course, an interactive and evolving case study immerses you in the SDLC of a project from inception to product release. Working in small groups, you employ both PC-based and paper tools to gain first-hand knowledge and experience in all SCM processes and tasks. Activities include: Matching software project needs to SCM process capability Gathering the attributes and characteristics to create a Configuration Item list Designing a change control process that accommodates change requests and problem reports Creating a design baseline Identifying key reports needed for effective SCM communications FREE After-Course Instructor Coaching You may schedule a free coaching session with your instructor to ask questions and receive guidance.

In this workshop, We will share with you the lessons from teams we observed who have successfully made the transition. We&#39;ll explore the requisite team skills, how to deal with agile requirements, the right strategies for developing agile automation, how to plan and test within your agile team, effective agile test metrics, and aspects of quality for agile teams. The lessons will be shared via real stories from real agile teams who have crossed this road —no hypothetical examples here! And wrap up the session by sharing the cheat sheet of Agile Testing model to help you define and refine your agile transformation strategies. All in all, you will walk away from this session knowing how to begin your agile transformation or, if you&#39;re already mired in agility, how to raise the bar for increased and sustained performance. Learning Objectives: The keys in building or transitioning your teams towards agile—what skills and characteristics to look for The level of planning, execution, and reporting that is relevant for agile testing within teams The keys to building and maintaining a multi-tiered agile automation approach The central changes test leadership and management needs to make in order to support the transformation How important it is to move from a testing focus towards a quality focus; and strategies for doing it High Level Outline: This is a full day workshop, split into 2-3 hour sessions. On Day #1 we&#39;ll explore more from a team perspective Mindset of the agile tester Testing activity within the sprint Requirements, documentation, bugs – oh my! On Day #2 we&#39;ll focus more on agile automation, team leadership, metrics, and the 3Pillar strategy for agile adoption.

Join us at the evening of May 28, 2015 for a happy hour fundraiser and help us hit our $250,000 goal. We&#39;re seeking to expand our impact for the 2015-2016 school year and close the tech divide for San Francisco&#39;s most disvantaged communities. At this casual event of friends and colleagues, you&#39;ll hear from Mission Bit&#39;s leadership, students and San Francisco tech leaders about the impact we&#39;ve had in public schools and our vision for the future.<p><strong><br></strong><p><strong>Call </strong><strong>to Action:</strong> We have an aggressive fundriasing goal of $250,000 and we&#39;re seeking to address an urgent issue. We encourage you to give at the level most appropriate and to bring your friends/colleagues to support our call to action.<p><strong><br></strong><p><strong>Expected Impact of your $250,000 investment:</strong><ul><li>Engage 500 students that have never coded either through our intro courses and Hacker Lab<li>Secure internships for 100% students that have the skills to start coding professionally<li>Train and support 100 new coding volunteers to help run courses</li></li></li></ul><p> <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> By the year 2018, 2.4 million STEM jobs will go unfilled. In San Francisco fewer than 5% of public school students are enrolled in a computer science course. Out of the 10,000 students who took the AP exam in 2014, just 2.2% took the computer science exam. Fewer than 15% of those students were female, and not one African American student took the exam. The digital divide in San Francisco is an urgent and critical issue, and with your support Mission Bit is going to help elminate it.<p> <p><strong>The History:</strong> For the past 2 years, Mission Bit has been run by community volunteers who wanted to expand opportunities for young people in the tech industry. They started teaching coding classes and soon learned that the digitial divide and a lack of access to computer science education was locking an entire generation of San Franciscians out of jobs that were being created in their own backyard.<p><br><p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Mission Bit offers project-based courses for free to public school students. The courses are taught in multiple coding languages by volunteer software developers.<p> <p><strong>The Results:</strong> Over 250 students have taken a course with Mission Bit and we&#39;ve trained over 150 community volunteers to either teach a course or mentor a student. Last summer, 20% of students that took a Mission Bit course were placed in paid summer internships in coding positions.<p><br><p><strong>The Future:</strong> Mission Bit is transitioning from a volunteer program to an established non-profit committed to closing the tech divide for students in San Francisco and eventually, the country. We&#39;re raising $250,000 to ensure we have the resources to deepen our impact.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"], ["end_time", "2015-05-28 20:00:00.000000"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgs fundraisers 3.jpg"], ["name", "Mission Bit Spring 2015 Fundraiser: Closing the Tech Divide"], ["start_time", "2015-05-28 18:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:25:07.347961"], ["venue", "Buffalo Club"]]

Schlesinger will lead participants through the nuances of his own process and craft, including his specific interest in the ethics of making, and how joinery can be seen as a material metaphor for &quot;being together&quot;. Instruction will be given on how to bring these aesthetic and embodied approaches to bear through project conceptualization, layout, and final execution of a small, take-home sculpture.

The three-day event runs Friday - Sunday, April 10-12 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day on West Portal Avenue between 15th and Ulloa.<br><br>Local residents and tourists alike flock to admire the works of more than 40 artists displaying everything from photography, paintings, ceramics, jewelry and much more. The show is free to the public and is presented by the West Portal Avenue Association. Among the featured artists at this year&#39;s show:<br><br>Jennifer Clifford<br>Studio: San Francisco <br>Medium: Mixed Media<br>Art: Drawing inspiration from the beautiful San Francisco Bay, Jennifer creates whimsical collage and screen print art.<br>Creative Process: Jennifer&#39;s collage work incorporates media from variety of paper materials, including wallpaper, old ticket stubs, Muni and BART passes, maps, newsprint, rice paper, and vintage magazines. Vibrant offbeat fabrics are also found in her collages, some of which are repurposed clothes. Her screen print work is created from her photography. She prints on fabric and/or wallpaper and mounts each print to a wood panel. She describes her approach to design as textural, colorful, resourceful, imperfect, and eclectic.<br><br>John Osterhaug<br>Studio: San Francisco <br>Medium: Glass<br>Art: Jewelry<br>Creative Process: Since the 1980s, John has made glass jewelry, including cufflinks for men, by creating bright and reflective, almost neon color on fused glass with oxidizing metals, which he kiln fires. John creates all of his work from start to finish. He begins the process by cutting, sanding, drilling and kiln-firing multi-colored pieces of glass and then crafts them into earrings, pendants, rings, necklaces and bracelets. &quot;The method that I use to create my jewelry results in a unique set of work exhibiting a luminescent quality that glistens and glows as you move it,&quot; said John.<br><br>Locke Heemstra<br>Studio: San Mateo<br>Medium: Giclée photographic prints, which are individually produced, high-resolution prints made using a sophisticated wide format inkjet printer technology. <br>Art: Locke&#39;s photographic images are printed on large canvas, then cut to size and stretched over 1-1/4&quot; stretcher bars. The 1-1/4 inch edges of the photographic canvases have a unique artistic appearance as the image continues to fold around the sides to the back, eliminating the need for frames or glass.<br>Creative Process: Locke&#39;s early images focused on the natural wonders of the United States, from the rich fall foliage of New England to the vivid blues and greens of the California coast. In time, he began to concentrate on natural and manmade settings lush with color. The public&#39;s enthusiastic response to the vibrant colors in his work convinced Locke he was on the right path. Next, he decided to combine his love of European culture with his new approach to color. Today, Locke travels to Europe at least three times a year, always searching for that special image that will give the viewer a sense of place. <br><br>For more information about the West Portal Avenue Sidewalk Arts and Crafts Fair contact the West Portal Avenue Association at (415) 566-3500 or Pacific Fine Arts Festivals at (209) 267-4394 or visit <a href=\"http://www.pacificfinearts.com/\" rel=\"nowfollow\" rel=\"nowfollow\" rel=\"nowfollow\">http://www.pacificfinearts.com</a> on Facebook at <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/PacificFineArts\" rel=\"nowfollow\" rel=\"nowfollow\" rel=\"nowfollow\">http://www.facebook.com/PacificFineArts</a> and Twitter @PacificFineArts"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgsart2.jpg"], ["name", "West Portal Sidewalk Fine Arts & Crafts Fair"], ["start_time", "2015-04-11 00:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:25:44.460747"], ["venue", "West Portal Ave Association"]]

With infectious grooves and melodies that take you for a ride, Project Queue turns any venue into a funky, driving, high-energy party. Willy Jordan on drums (who’s played with acts like John Lee Hooker, Elvin Bishop, Charlie Mussellwhite, Angel Streli, Joe Louis Walker, Volker Strifler, Carlos Santana, Eric Lindell, Doyle Brammall, and Brotherhood of Groove) and Andy Levine on bass (who holds a PhD in Groovology) lay down some of the tightest grooves you’ll ever hear. Jonathan Lancaster (an award winning, conservatory trained musician) chimes in on saxophone with a sound heavily influenced by artists like Hank Mobley and Pharaoh Sanders, while Neal (a classical pianist) drops some insanely funky lines on keys. John McCartney (toured with Tina Turner, Al Green and Rick James) sprinkles in driving hand percussion and Kimberly (a bluegrass specialist and classical virtuoso) adds soaring fiddle melodies to the mix. Founder, The Redman is a fusion, funk and rock connoisseur, having studied music composition at the university level, delivering a high-energy style reminiscent of Tommy Bolin. <b><u>GOLD MINOR</u></b> Co-writers and original founding members Michael Carney and Adam Dragland began a musical venture over a decade ago in Saratoga Springs, New York. Their initial collaboration 7 Stories Falling landed an eclectic range of opening slots withDashboard Confessionals, Ludacris, Blue Oyster Cult and other established artists along the east coast. After relocating to the Bay Area in 2006, the pair spent several years performing under the name Team Candy, and The First Church of the Sacred Silversexual all the while writing, recording and searching for the right musical recipe. Jesse Ray Smith had ventured from Marin to San Francisco with The Pheromones, acquired ‘Gulch Alley Studios’, and co-founded acclaimed blues-soul rock outfit The Bad Jones. Simultaneously, Seattle rock theater drummer John Hollis (Hedwig, Ian Moore, Gerald Collier, Burning Opera SF) headed south from the soggy, forested Northwest music scene after a residency in SF with The Burning Opera. With the addition of Hollis and Smith at Gulch Alley Studios, Gold Minor found it’s completion, it’s home and its form. <b><u>HAIGHT STREET ALLSTARS</u></b> <i>(Performing straight offa their Haight Street Festival Star Show)</i> The Haight Street All-Stars are a fun and soulful R&B band led by the San Francisco musical icon Todd Tholke. In addition to being a music producer and recording artist, Todd Tholke is a passionate guitarist and powerful vocalist with over 25 years experience. Todd’s Haight Street All-Stars will get the crowd dancing with their unique expression of old blues and Motown favorites by greats such as B.B King and James Brown. The Haight Street All-Stars have a full summer performing venues all over the Bay Area and they are one of the highlighted bands at this year’s Haight Street Fair. <b><u>STRANGE HOTEL</u></b> Strange Hotel is a San Francisco based, four-piece Rock band. The band is consisted of lead singer and guitarist Frank Abreau Salazar, guitarist Sean Reilly, drummer Timi Aristil, and Myles Deiaco on bass. Their distinct range of musical influences and taste for art collides, creating a relatable and unique interpretation of music. Some call their colorful yet sometimes dark approach, “Gothedelic”. Along with rocking out, they don’t shy away from embracing the simplicity of an acoustic composition and the assurance it carries.<br>$10 <b>**<u>Suggested Donation</u>**</b> – www.boomboomtickets.com"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgsmusic1.jpg"], ["name", "PROJECT QUEUE (+ GOLD MINOR, STRANGE HOTEL, HAIGHT ST ALLSTARS) – Nepal Benefit"], ["start_time", "2015-06-23 21:30:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:25:46.111789"], ["venue", "Boom Boom Room"]]

Hes revered by countless fellow artists, and has built a remarkably loyal international audience through his tireless touring. His deceptively straightforward songs embody timeless qualities of humanity, optimism, emotional insight and a boundless sense of humor, untainted by cynicism or transient notions of hipness.The records that Jonathan Richman has made over the past 30 years have long held a special place in the hearts of his fans. He began playing guitar at the age of 15, and in the early 1970s formed the Modern Lovers, whose raw, minimalist sound and emotionally forthright songs helped to lay the groundwork for punk rock. But by the time the groups landmark debut album (including the much-covered Road Runner, a Top Five single in Europe) was released in 1976, Jonathan had already moved on to a quieter sound and a gentler lyrical focus. Since then, hes continued to record and tour prolifically, first with a series of Modern Lovers lineups, later on his own, and eventually as a duo with drummer Tommy Larkins. Over the years, Jonathans music has absorbed a multitude of influences, from doo-wop to country to a variety of international styles, without sacrificing the artists effervescent personality.Jonathans fans have remained fiercely devoted over the years, and his audience expanded substantially in the 1990s, thanks to his frequent guest spots on TVs Late Night with Conan OBrien, his prominent appearance in the 1998 film comedy smash Theres Something About Mary, and the inclusions of his Modern Lovers classics Ice Cream Man and Im A Little Airplane on Sesame Street.For much of his career, Jonathan has toured almost almost nonstop around the world. Traveling and playing for new people in new places is one of my favorite things, he notes. Its great playing places that are off the beaten track. You can learn a lot when you play in a little town in Holland or Western Australia, and you learn different things than you would learn playing a big city. This year were going to try to play in Extremadura, which is the southwest of Spainwe might become the first American entertainers ever to play there. Im hoping that we can able to play the Canary Islands soon.photo Playing shows and making records keeps been getting easier and more fun, Jonathan states, adding, Me and Tommy play totally different than we played two years ago. We already play a different style than we played on that live DVD, and the way we played then was totally different from the way we played three years before that. I still feel like were just starting out, and I still learn new stuff every night."], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgsmusic2.jpg"], ["name", "Jonathan Richman"], ["performer", "Jonathan Richman"], ["start_time", "2015-06-23 20:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:25:46.121847"], ["venue", "Sweetwater Music Hall"]]

Seed Stage Angel investors generally invest $100,000-$200,000 per person in early stage technology companies as compared to traditional Angels who may invest $25,000 to $50,000 in a deal. If you are an entrepreneur in a startup that is currently seeking capital and would like to present your best two-minute (time limit is strictly enforced) elevator pitch to a panel of Angels, you must follow the instructions below. Pitching slots go quickly, so sign up early! To Present a Pitch You must register in advance; presenters are assigned on a first-come basis and slot availability is confirmed automatically during registration; the maximum number of presenters is 10, plus 4 ‘no guarantee’ Standby slots. Once you register additional guidelines will be sent. You must RSVP receipt. Your pitch is two minutes, timing is strictly enforced, no handouts, cards, demos or samples allowed during or immediately after your presentation. Your pitch is followed by 4 minutes of Q&A by the panel; and 4 minutes of non-rebuttal feedback from each panelist. Only one person from the company may present the (2) minute pitch to the investors and answer questions from the panel. Entrepreneurs not yet ready to pitch or unable to reserve a pitch slot are encouraged register and attend.  By listening to the pitches, the Q&A, and the critiques you learn the key points required to develop an effective pitch that investors value. You also have the opportunity to network with investors person to person at the event. If you are an investor, come and listen to the entrepreneurs’ pitches—you never know where you’ll find your next deal. Learn how other investors rate the pitches; which Angels pass and for what reasons; and which entrepreneurs other Angels want to talk to ASAP.   If you are interested in serving on a Pitch or Workshop panel please contact Valerie Badgett, Program Manager.

Developing a mutually beneficial business relationship with the best agent or agency for you is often a crucial step in your successful career. If you are currently seeking representation, or think you might want to at some point in your career, this is an essential event you won’t want to miss. Join APA as these top artists’ agents candidly discuss important topics like: Who should have a rep? What exactly can a rep do for me? What exactly can I do for a rep? What stage in my career is the best time to have representation? How do I get the right rep for me? What kind of promos are effective in attracting a rep? How do I work efficiently with my rep? What are the typical percentages a rep earns? When I first start working with a rep, what will they expect me to do? How will my marketing change when I get a rep? What kinds of new clients can I expect to get? How do I set up a mutually beneficial contract with my rep? When the time comes, how do I amicably end my partnership with my rep?   MODERATOR Kate Chase   Artist Agent with Brite Productions and founder of ThePantry.biz In 2006, after more than 15-years of managing relationships and projects at post-production boutique Wild Studio, Kate took notice of some of the industry&#39;s finest retoucher&#39;s as they headed in new directions and realized a role in a new category of representation with Kate Chase Presents, and its mission to promote retouchers as craftsmen.  Her commitment to helping artists and clients continues today at Brite Productions, representing 8 conceptual talents and on special occasions, consulting for retouching projects.

Your child will learn everything necessary to build and customize their first app. We provide an introduction to programming, Swift, and Xcode. Kids enjoy seeing the immediate results of their learnings and taking control of what happens on an iPad or iPhone screen. At the end of the camp, your child will have learned: How the Apple development workflow is structured How to setup and work with Xcode How to build a simple app using Swift Programming basics Swift basics   Your child will leave camp with a basic understanding of development and the ability to modify the app they created in-class.  The camp is designed for kids who are highly motivated by programming and interested in learning new skills. Typical grade levels are 5-8. We’ll include some fun outdoor activities at lunch time. This will be the third season of our programming camps. Last year&#39;s winter session was quite successful in helping kids learn Java. Every attendee rated the camp 10 out of 10, and one parent noted: I enrolled my 10-year old son in Jack Youstra’s Java/Minecraft class. Jack made the class fun and informational. He explained the material and asked questions for the kids to answer. While his focus was to teach, his goal was to make the experience fun, so that the kids don’t get intimidated by the tech. I would recommend Jack’s class to other kids. - Phu Hoang (parent)      EA Tour As part of the camp, we will be offering a tour to Electronic Arts Headquarters at Redwood Shores. This tour will be on 6/30/15 from 1:00pm to 3:00pm. Due to transportation time, your child will be back at approximately 3:45. This is a great opportunity to tour a hub of game production.

The next generation of research space is ultra-flexible: a “plug and play” chassis that incorporate principles of transparency, collaboration, flexibility and access to the outdoors.   In-depth dialogue about the intersections between research and workplace trends can help identify the guiding principles for transforming lab design in the next few decades. Evolving workplace structures, such as the flattening of organizational hierarchies, will affect the spatial relationships of lab functions. Emerging technologies and how they are adopted by lab users are also important to consider.    As young scientists enter the post-doctoral and faculty ranks, architects and lab planners need to re-think the way research environments are designed so these facilities will best serve the next generation of scientists.   In the last two decades, design principles such as spatial flexibility, sustainability, energy efficiency and access to daylight and views have shifted approaches to laboratory design. What principles will affect lab planning in the future? Will we see greater integration between computational laboratories and more traditional benched labs? Growth in multi-functional spaces? Will new spatial models include innovation hubs, where multiple functions such as basic experimentation, computer simulation, prototyping and interaction are accommodated in one space? Most importantly, how will the next generation of scientists engage in the research process?    NBBJ is convening a panel discussion to explore – qualitatively and quantitatively – the next generation computational research lab.  We will discuss how tech startups have created space that effectively supports idea generation and peer-to-peer collaboration, and how those principles might be adapted to today’s lab environments — where crunching data is as much a shared activity as bench research.    Moderated Panel Discussion   Join the conversation on Twitter: #LabTechSF   Schedule: 6:30pm-7:15pm – Cocktails and Hors d&#39;oeuvres 7:15pm-8:00pm – Panel Discussion 8:00pm-8:30pm – Audience Q&A "], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgstechnology3.jpg"], ["name", "Lab + Tech"], ["start_time", "2015-07-22 18:30:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:25:52.635218"], ["venue", "NBBJ"]]

If you are looking for the answer to these questions, you will certainly benefit from attending this seminar on preparing for FDA inspections:   • Do you worry about an upcoming FDA inspection?   • Do you know how you should behave during the inspection?   • Do you know what an end to end FDA inspection process looks like?   • Do you know what an FDA investigator(s) will look for?   • Do you know how to proactively assess and mitigate FDA compliance risks?   • Do you know what information you should get ready ahead of an FDA inspection?   • Does your organization have a game plan for managing an FDA inspection?   • Does your organization know how to respond to and manage FDA observations (483s), or warning letters?     The FDA inspection is one of the critical measures of your quality system and your organization as a whole. Since a perfect quality system is usually not implemented, the preparation for and management of an FDA inspection is critically important. A well-established quality system provides a solid foundation for passing FDA inspections; however, if you don’t proactively examine your quality system from the perspective of a FDA inspector, you can still have difficulties. A less than perfect quality system has the potential to attract FDA observations, but if you prepare, proactively identify and mitigate the compliance risks, you can still achieve good inspection results and avoid or minimize negative impact on your business. Based on extensive experience of both managing inspections from the industry side and conducting inspections from FDA side, this seminar will share insights about FDA inspections and provide a set of comprehensive strategies and instructions on how to prepare for and manage an FDA inspection, including how to follow-up and closing out 483s or Warning Letters.     By attending this seminar on preparing for FDA inspection, participants will learn:   • Background about FDA inspection program.   • How to proactively assess quality system readiness for FDA inspection.   • How to identify compliance risks.   • How to proactively mitigate before, during and after the inspection.   • How to respond to 483s and warning letters including templates based on industry best practices.  Additionally attendees will be provided with:  • Toolkit on how to assess a quality system’s readiness, and identify and mitigate potential compliance risks.   • A checklist of information that should be prepared prior to inspection.   • A strategy template on how to manage a FDA inspection (front room, back room, role playing, dos and don’ts, etc.).  Toolkit on how to prepare responses to 483 observations and warning letters.     Course Objectives:   • To provide an overview of the FDA inspection program and key success factors for a manufacturer.  • To introduce the best practices on how to manage inspections including a template of game plan.   • To introduce the industry best practices on what information should be prepared ahead of inspection including a checklist.  • To introduce the best practices including templates on how to respond to and closeout FDA 483s and warning letters.   • To introduce the best practices and toolkit on how to assess readiness for a FDA inspection, and how to proactively identify and mitigate compliance risks.    Who will Benefit:   This course will provide valuable assistance and guidance to all regulated companies that are preparing for FDA inspections. The following job titles/ positions will benefit from attending this seminar:   • Quality Engineers   • Managers   • Directors   • VPs, Regulatory Affairs   • Auditors   • Risk Managers   • Compliance Officers   • Management Representatives   • Management with Executive Responsibilities   • Members of Senior Management Team   • Validation Managers "], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgstechnology1.jpg"], ["name", "How to Prepare for, Manage, and Follow-up to an FDA Inspection: Risk-driven Approach 2 day In-Person Seminar"], ["start_time", "2015-06-18 08:30:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:25:52.653516"], ["venue", "Hilton"]]

Join us at the evening of May 28, 2015 for a happy hour fundraiser and help us hit our $250,000 goal. We&#39;re seeking to expand our impact for the 2015-2016 school year and close the tech divide for San Francisco&#39;s most disvantaged communities. At this casual event of friends and colleagues, you&#39;ll hear from Mission Bit&#39;s leadership, students and San Francisco tech leaders about the impact we&#39;ve had in public schools and our vision for the future.<p><strong><br></strong><p><strong>Call </strong><strong>to Action:</strong> We have an aggressive fundriasing goal of $250,000 and we&#39;re seeking to address an urgent issue. We encourage you to give at the level most appropriate and to bring your friends/colleagues to support our call to action.<p><strong><br></strong><p><strong>Expected Impact of your $250,000 investment:</strong><ul><li>Engage 500 students that have never coded either through our intro courses and Hacker Lab<li>Secure internships for 100% students that have the skills to start coding professionally<li>Train and support 100 new coding volunteers to help run courses</li></li></li></ul><p> <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> By the year 2018, 2.4 million STEM jobs will go unfilled. In San Francisco fewer than 5% of public school students are enrolled in a computer science course. Out of the 10,000 students who took the AP exam in 2014, just 2.2% took the computer science exam. Fewer than 15% of those students were female, and not one African American student took the exam. The digital divide in San Francisco is an urgent and critical issue, and with your support Mission Bit is going to help elminate it.<p> <p><strong>The History:</strong> For the past 2 years, Mission Bit has been run by community volunteers who wanted to expand opportunities for young people in the tech industry. They started teaching coding classes and soon learned that the digitial divide and a lack of access to computer science education was locking an entire generation of San Franciscians out of jobs that were being created in their own backyard.<p><br><p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Mission Bit offers project-based courses for free to public school students. The courses are taught in multiple coding languages by volunteer software developers.<p> <p><strong>The Results:</strong> Over 250 students have taken a course with Mission Bit and we&#39;ve trained over 150 community volunteers to either teach a course or mentor a student. Last summer, 20% of students that took a Mission Bit course were placed in paid summer internships in coding positions.<p><br><p><strong>The Future:</strong> Mission Bit is transitioning from a volunteer program to an established non-profit committed to closing the tech divide for students in San Francisco and eventually, the country. We&#39;re raising $250,000 to ensure we have the resources to deepen our impact.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"], ["end_time", "2015-05-28 20:00:00.000000"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgsfundraisers2.jpg"], ["name", "Mission Bit Spring 2015 Fundraiser: Closing the Tech Divide"], ["start_time", "2015-05-28 18:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:25:55.359562"], ["venue", "Buffalo Club"]]

Roberta Donnay has been dubbed &quot;a rebel jazzer&quot; and it fits. Donnay, who currently tours with Dan Hicks and the Hot Licks, is now focusing her energy on this hip tribute to her favorite Prohibition Era women singers. Dan Hicks gives her new project a big thumbs up, saying: &quot;I really like what she&#39;s doing! It&#39;s tasty!&quot; The beguiling and entertaining release &quot;A Little Sugar&quot; is an impeccably produced bit of jazz and blues confection for her new NYC based label MOTEMA. The slight red head with the engaging smile has great passion behind her love of this Prohibition proto-jazz. &quot;The women who sang, and in some cases wrote, these songs are heroic. Their attitude and energy is strong, confident, courageous and vibrant. They&#39;re no push-overs for any man!&quot; she declares with a grin. The first ten people who come in Prohibition Era costume will get a prize from the band. Roberta Donnay is a jazz recording artist and award-winning singer/songwriter, who has been making music professionally since the age of 16, touring Europe with a knapsack and sleeping bag. She&#39;s worked as a performing artist for over 25 years and performed with or opened for many top artists (including Ernestine Anderson, Bob Dorough, David Grisman, John Hammond, Herbie Hancock, Dan Hicks, and others). Rainforest Records and other labels have released 6 of her CDs; her vocals and songs have been featured in film and TV, including The Young and The Restless, The UNIT, NUMBE3RS, PAN AM, Nash Bridges, and others. Ms. Donnay wrote &quot;One World&quot;, a world peace anthem for the United Nations&#39; 50th which was adoped by schools and world peace performances around the world, and chosen as the theme for World AIDS Day in South Africa in 2003. Donnay is featured in Scott Yanow&#39;s book &quot;THE JAZZ SINGER&quot; the top 521 jazz singers of all time&quot;."], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgs/music2.jpg"], ["name", "Roberta Donnay & The Prohibition Mob Band"], ["start_time", "2015-07-26 20:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:30:02.084207"], ["venue", "Sweetwater Music Hall"]]

The artist is a self-taught musician who built his own guitar and was a featured player and singer in Yeti back in the &#39;90s. The educator is a classically trained pianist who plays Beethoven for fun. The doctor and the Realtor grew up together and played in ska, funk, and dance bands back in the late &#39;80s. All four have been playing music for fun, for meditation, and because it feeds their soul.  They brought all of this kinetic and eclectic energy together to form Home, a San Francisco based funk/blues/rock/jam/jazzy band. Drawing on influences from the Allman Brothers, Stevie Wonder, Hendrix, Duke Ellington, James Brown, Phish, the Beatles, Curtis Mayfield, George Clinton, Miles Davis, and many others, Home is a band cut from the unique cultural cloth of San Francisco’s music scene. This four piece band with Mark Cambell on guitar and vocals, Mark Isero on keyboard, Peter Coopersmith on drums and vocals, and Jonathan Dearman on bass and vocals is a testament to what happens when love and respect of music come together.

Join us at the evening of May 28, 2015 for a happy hour fundraiser and help us hit our $250,000 goal. We&#39;re seeking to expand our impact for the 2015-2016 school year and close the tech divide for San Francisco&#39;s most disvantaged communities. At this casual event of friends and colleagues, you&#39;ll hear from Mission Bit&#39;s leadership, students and San Francisco tech leaders about the impact we&#39;ve had in public schools and our vision for the future.<p><strong><br></strong><p><strong>Call </strong><strong>to Action:</strong> We have an aggressive fundriasing goal of $250,000 and we&#39;re seeking to address an urgent issue. We encourage you to give at the level most appropriate and to bring your friends/colleagues to support our call to action.<p><strong><br></strong><p><strong>Expected Impact of your $250,000 investment:</strong><ul><li>Engage 500 students that have never coded either through our intro courses and Hacker Lab<li>Secure internships for 100% students that have the skills to start coding professionally<li>Train and support 100 new coding volunteers to help run courses</li></li></li></ul><p> <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> By the year 2018, 2.4 million STEM jobs will go unfilled. In San Francisco fewer than 5% of public school students are enrolled in a computer science course. Out of the 10,000 students who took the AP exam in 2014, just 2.2% took the computer science exam. Fewer than 15% of those students were female, and not one African American student took the exam. The digital divide in San Francisco is an urgent and critical issue, and with your support Mission Bit is going to help elminate it.<p> <p><strong>The History:</strong> For the past 2 years, Mission Bit has been run by community volunteers who wanted to expand opportunities for young people in the tech industry. They started teaching coding classes and soon learned that the digitial divide and a lack of access to computer science education was locking an entire generation of San Franciscians out of jobs that were being created in their own backyard.<p><br><p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Mission Bit offers project-based courses for free to public school students. The courses are taught in multiple coding languages by volunteer software developers.<p> <p><strong>The Results:</strong> Over 250 students have taken a course with Mission Bit and we&#39;ve trained over 150 community volunteers to either teach a course or mentor a student. Last summer, 20% of students that took a Mission Bit course were placed in paid summer internships in coding positions.<p><br><p><strong>The Future:</strong> Mission Bit is transitioning from a volunteer program to an established non-profit committed to closing the tech divide for students in San Francisco and eventually, the country. We&#39;re raising $250,000 to ensure we have the resources to deepen our impact.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"], ["end_time", "2015-05-28 20:00:00.000000"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgs/fundraisers1.jpg"], ["name", "Mission Bit Spring 2015 Fundraiser: Closing the Tech Divide"], ["start_time", "2015-05-28 18:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:30:09.774665"], ["venue", "Buffalo Club"]]

Roberta Donnay has been dubbed &quot;a rebel jazzer&quot; and it fits. Donnay, who currently tours with Dan Hicks and the Hot Licks, is now focusing her energy on this hip tribute to her favorite Prohibition Era women singers. Dan Hicks gives her new project a big thumbs up, saying: &quot;I really like what she&#39;s doing! It&#39;s tasty!&quot; The beguiling and entertaining release &quot;A Little Sugar&quot; is an impeccably produced bit of jazz and blues confection for her new NYC based label MOTEMA. The slight red head with the engaging smile has great passion behind her love of this Prohibition proto-jazz. &quot;The women who sang, and in some cases wrote, these songs are heroic. Their attitude and energy is strong, confident, courageous and vibrant. They&#39;re no push-overs for any man!&quot; she declares with a grin. The first ten people who come in Prohibition Era costume will get a prize from the band. Roberta Donnay is a jazz recording artist and award-winning singer/songwriter, who has been making music professionally since the age of 16, touring Europe with a knapsack and sleeping bag. She&#39;s worked as a performing artist for over 25 years and performed with or opened for many top artists (including Ernestine Anderson, Bob Dorough, David Grisman, John Hammond, Herbie Hancock, Dan Hicks, and others). Rainforest Records and other labels have released 6 of her CDs; her vocals and songs have been featured in film and TV, including The Young and The Restless, The UNIT, NUMBE3RS, PAN AM, Nash Bridges, and others. Ms. Donnay wrote &quot;One World&quot;, a world peace anthem for the United Nations&#39; 50th which was adoped by schools and world peace performances around the world, and chosen as the theme for World AIDS Day in South Africa in 2003. Donnay is featured in Scott Yanow&#39;s book &quot;THE JAZZ SINGER&quot; the top 521 jazz singers of all time&quot;."], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgs/music2.jpg"], ["name", "Roberta Donnay & The Prohibition Mob Band"], ["start_time", "2015-07-26 20:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:30:17.119031"], ["venue", "Sweetwater Music Hall"]]

The artist is a self-taught musician who built his own guitar and was a featured player and singer in Yeti back in the &#39;90s. The educator is a classically trained pianist who plays Beethoven for fun. The doctor and the Realtor grew up together and played in ska, funk, and dance bands back in the late &#39;80s. All four have been playing music for fun, for meditation, and because it feeds their soul.  They brought all of this kinetic and eclectic energy together to form Home, a San Francisco based funk/blues/rock/jam/jazzy band. Drawing on influences from the Allman Brothers, Stevie Wonder, Hendrix, Duke Ellington, James Brown, Phish, the Beatles, Curtis Mayfield, George Clinton, Miles Davis, and many others, Home is a band cut from the unique cultural cloth of San Francisco’s music scene. This four piece band with Mark Cambell on guitar and vocals, Mark Isero on keyboard, Peter Coopersmith on drums and vocals, and Jonathan Dearman on bass and vocals is a testament to what happens when love and respect of music come together.

Tax strategies will also be covered, as will short term rentals through platforms like Air B’n’B.  \n\nReal estate maintains its appeal for investors because of relatively low interest rates and many tax advantages this type of investing offers. Because properties are hard assets, many investors feel more secure when they are able to diversify into real estate holdings, to complement their stock, bond and fund investments.\n\nCost is $15 for early registrations, $20 at the door. Hors d’oeuvres are offered. There will be a no-host cash bar starting at 5:30 p.m.; presentation starts at 6 p.m.  Trek Winery is located on Machin Ave., Novato.

WINC helps women, especially artists, healers and creative types, get super focused on driving their revenue up, within an intimate and collaborative culture of women doing it together. Myka teachers a simple, but highly strategic four-part system called, The Engine of Your Business Revenue, that builds a powerful focus in the four areas of a woman’s business that actually generates money. Myka discovered this system when she too struggled to turn her passion into profit. Once she cracked this code, she went from not making any money into a fully profitable business in 6 weeks, and a six-figure business in 9 months, with continued growth since. She has worked with over 100 women in WINC’s three-month Program.<br> Myka graduated with distinction from the University of Colorado with a degree in Economics and International Affairs, and has been self-employed since she was fifteen years old.<p><strong>Testimonials</strong><p> <em>In the first and second month of the Program I hit my revenue goals, and in the third month, I made double my revenue goal!</em> ~ Reilly Jernigan, Massage Therapist / Acupuncturist<p> <em>This Program is by far THE BEST decision I have ever made for the health of my business.

In 1983 Jane moved from the UK to the US with just a suitcase, beauty school diploma and boyfriend. Jane and her boyfriend-turned-husband, Raymond, founded the International Dermal institute the same year, which now educates more than 75,000 skin therapists every year and can be found in 14 locations around the world. And this is just the prequel to Jane’s entrepreneurial tale; she went on to found cult skincare brand Dermalogica in 1986. Her business model is a bit unheard of. For starters, she has never taken a bank loan and Dermalogica has remained a privately owned company despite its mammoth size. Today, Dermalogica products are loved for everything they don’t contain (harsh irritants, fragrances) and are the number-one choice of more than 100,000 professional skin therapists; they can be found in more than 80 countries worldwide and have 50 offices. Since 2010, Jane has been a member of the Clinton Global Initiative, and is part of their Women and Girls Action Committee – and, in 2011, she founded FITE (Financial Independence Through Entrepreneurship), an initiative that helps women, especially in developing countries, fulfil their entrepreneurial dreams. And FITE has already helped more than 50,000 women in 68 countries start or grow their own businesses. This breakfast with Jane will be the perfect way to reward your clients and staff – or come on your own and meet a whole lot of other Business Chicks! You’ll walk away inspired and ready for more.

Software configuration management (SCM) is a process for facilitating and controlling changes to software products within an organization. This course covers configuration activities such as: configuration planning, change control and management, system building, and version and release management. You learn how the application core processes of SCM contribute to the success of a software project. A software and hardware prototype is used in the case study throughout the course, allowing the concepts of SCM to be applied during workshops and activities. What background do I need? No particular programming language or specific software expertise is assumed. Familiarity with a software development life cycle is helpful. Who will benefit from this course? The course is valuable to software development and maintenance personnel coding or designing systems, systems administrators and those leading software-intensive activities such as business analysts, project leaders and configuration managers. Anyone involved with software development, integration, maintenance, operations, testing, quality assurance or process improvement benefits from this course. Does my whole development team need to attend? While beneficial to entire development teams, providing a foundation for representatives of each group would be a good starting point. It is also not necessary that the entire development team attend at the same time, and onsite options for your company are also available. Please ask your Sales representative if onsite is something of interest to you. Is the course linked to a specific CM approach, programming language or operating system? No. The practical techniques that the course advocates are applicable to mainframes, servers, workstations and personal computers across the spectrum of operating systems. Is the course relevant for all types of programming teams? Yes. This course is beneficial to one person teams as well as teams with large co-located groups as well as geographically dispersed groups. The course approaches the software development life cycle by considering phases in development, not by aligning with one approach or another. SCM applies at the SDLC phase, regardless of the type, size, language, or budget of a programming project. Are SCM techniques effective for projects of varying sizes and complexity? Software expected to have long operational life needs to be maintained and altered over time. It may need to be distributed to multiple locations or modified to run on a different platform. Software in fast-changing Web applications with aggressive, market-drive deadlines also need to be controlled. The control mechanisms built into the software configuration management process ensure that these challenges are understood, controlled and supported. SCM concepts can be applied to any project, regardless of size and complexity. Are there software packages useful for configuration management? If so, will they be demonstrated during the course? Yes. The course focuses on the principles and application of SCM processes, taking a tool-independent approach. When you return to your work environment, the SCM principles built into the various tools of the industry will be evident and will then be able to be properly used according to the software vendor’s implementation. How much time is spent on each topic? Content Hours Foundation for configuration and release management 3.0 Identifying Configuration Items (CIs) 3.0 Controlling change 3.0 Communicating configuration status 2.0 Auditing in preparation for a release 2.0 Deciding on a build strategy 2.0 Developing a release strategy 2.0 Times, including the workshops, are estimates; exact times may vary according to the needs of each class. How much time does the course spend in activities? Approximately 40 percent of this course is spent in activities. Throughout the course, an interactive and evolving case study immerses you in the SDLC of a project from inception to product release. Working in small groups, you employ both PC-based and paper tools to gain first-hand knowledge and experience in all SCM processes and tasks. Activities include: Matching software project needs to SCM process capability Gathering the attributes and characteristics to create a Configuration Item list Designing a change control process that accommodates change requests and problem reports Creating a design baseline Identifying key reports needed for effective SCM communications FREE After-Course Instructor Coaching You may schedule a free coaching session with your instructor to ask questions and receive guidance.

In this workshop, We will share with you the lessons from teams we observed who have successfully made the transition. We&#39;ll explore the requisite team skills, how to deal with agile requirements, the right strategies for developing agile automation, how to plan and test within your agile team, effective agile test metrics, and aspects of quality for agile teams. The lessons will be shared via real stories from real agile teams who have crossed this road —no hypothetical examples here! And wrap up the session by sharing the cheat sheet of Agile Testing model to help you define and refine your agile transformation strategies. All in all, you will walk away from this session knowing how to begin your agile transformation or, if you&#39;re already mired in agility, how to raise the bar for increased and sustained performance. Learning Objectives: The keys in building or transitioning your teams towards agile—what skills and characteristics to look for The level of planning, execution, and reporting that is relevant for agile testing within teams The keys to building and maintaining a multi-tiered agile automation approach The central changes test leadership and management needs to make in order to support the transformation How important it is to move from a testing focus towards a quality focus; and strategies for doing it High Level Outline: This is a full day workshop, split into 2-3 hour sessions. On Day #1 we&#39;ll explore more from a team perspective Mindset of the agile tester Testing activity within the sprint Requirements, documentation, bugs – oh my! On Day #2 we&#39;ll focus more on agile automation, team leadership, metrics, and the 3Pillar strategy for agile adoption.

If you are looking for the answer to these questions, you will certainly benefit from attending this seminar on preparing for FDA inspections:   • Do you worry about an upcoming FDA inspection?   • Do you know how you should behave during the inspection?   • Do you know what an end to end FDA inspection process looks like?   • Do you know what an FDA investigator(s) will look for?   • Do you know how to proactively assess and mitigate FDA compliance risks?   • Do you know what information you should get ready ahead of an FDA inspection?   • Does your organization have a game plan for managing an FDA inspection?   • Does your organization know how to respond to and manage FDA observations (483s), or warning letters?     The FDA inspection is one of the critical measures of your quality system and your organization as a whole. Since a perfect quality system is usually not implemented, the preparation for and management of an FDA inspection is critically important. A well-established quality system provides a solid foundation for passing FDA inspections; however, if you don’t proactively examine your quality system from the perspective of a FDA inspector, you can still have difficulties. A less than perfect quality system has the potential to attract FDA observations, but if you prepare, proactively identify and mitigate the compliance risks, you can still achieve good inspection results and avoid or minimize negative impact on your business. Based on extensive experience of both managing inspections from the industry side and conducting inspections from FDA side, this seminar will share insights about FDA inspections and provide a set of comprehensive strategies and instructions on how to prepare for and manage an FDA inspection, including how to follow-up and closing out 483s or Warning Letters.     By attending this seminar on preparing for FDA inspection, participants will learn:   • Background about FDA inspection program.   • How to proactively assess quality system readiness for FDA inspection.   • How to identify compliance risks.   • How to proactively mitigate before, during and after the inspection.   • How to respond to 483s and warning letters including templates based on industry best practices.  Additionally attendees will be provided with:  • Toolkit on how to assess a quality system’s readiness, and identify and mitigate potential compliance risks.   • A checklist of information that should be prepared prior to inspection.   • A strategy template on how to manage a FDA inspection (front room, back room, role playing, dos and don’ts, etc.).  Toolkit on how to prepare responses to 483 observations and warning letters.     Course Objectives:   • To provide an overview of the FDA inspection program and key success factors for a manufacturer.  • To introduce the best practices on how to manage inspections including a template of game plan.   • To introduce the industry best practices on what information should be prepared ahead of inspection including a checklist.  • To introduce the best practices including templates on how to respond to and closeout FDA 483s and warning letters.   • To introduce the best practices and toolkit on how to assess readiness for a FDA inspection, and how to proactively identify and mitigate compliance risks.    Who will Benefit:   This course will provide valuable assistance and guidance to all regulated companies that are preparing for FDA inspections. The following job titles/ positions will benefit from attending this seminar:   • Quality Engineers   • Managers   • Directors   • VPs, Regulatory Affairs   • Auditors   • Risk Managers   • Compliance Officers   • Management Representatives   • Management with Executive Responsibilities   • Members of Senior Management Team   • Validation Managers "], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgs/technology3.jpg"], ["name", "How to Prepare for, Manage, and Follow-up to an FDA Inspection: Risk-driven Approach 2 day In-Person Seminar"], ["start_time", "2015-06-18 08:30:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:30:22.853521"], ["venue", "Hilton"]]

Above Average Hoops is also a great opportunity for our youth to build relationships with one another as well as share common goals and dreams that they may have. The desire and willingness to learn is what will make this camp great!   "], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgs/sports3.jpg"], ["name", "Above Average Hoops Camp"], ["start_time", "2015-07-06 09:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:30:24.153824"], ["venue", "Nothing But Hoops"]]

Having hosted speakers as diverse as Sheryl Sandberg, Dan Savage and Rachel Maddow, INFORUM now invites SF’s finest citizens to support its onstage interviews by mingling and intellectualizing with a purpose. It’s a celebration, a meeting of the minds, but definitely a party. \n\nGuests are set to enjoy music from two of the city’s most sought after DJ talents: Popstack and Slaptop (the latter is on the verge of being the next big thing with upcoming performances at the Greek Theatre and Lollapalooza). It’s going to definitely be one of those “hot” San Francisco nights, as attendees swing and sway with SF young luminaries like Facebook’s Libby Leffler and Yelp’s Nish Nadaraja, all while enjoying complimentary eats from Chambers and drinks courtesy of ONEHOPE, Lagunitas and Suerte Tequila. \n\nIt gets better: everyone in attendance will also receive a free raffle ticket for prizes that include an AirBNB coupon code for $250, and 2 VIP party experience tickets for Kim Kardashian West Live  (front tier seating, a signed copy of Kim’s latest book Selfish, and a chance to meet the star herself!)\n\nThe Details:\nWhat: A party-style fundraiser complete with complimentary food catered by Chambers, an open bar, music from 2 top DJs, and plenty of the above mingling and social intellectualizing.\n \nWhere: Chambers, located inside the iconic Phoenix Hotel, itself a San Francisco landmark opened by former Commonwealth Club guest Chip Conley.\nAddress: 601 Eddy Street, San Francisco, CA 94109\n \nWhen: 7-11pm on Thursday, June 25th\n \nWhy: Proceeds from the event help bolster INFORUM’s work to bring conversations to the Bay Area. By hosting these onstage interviews, INFORUM has addressed issues such as diversity in tech with Kimberly Bryant and Sal Khan, reproductive rights with Cecile Richards, and racial justice with Cornel West.\n \nHost Committee Chair Nish Nadaraja on why: “&quot;The term &#39;curation&#39; gets thrown around a lot these days.

With the Iran nuclear deal front and center in the news, the evening will feature a timely discussion about nuclear threats over the past 70 years and how to resolve conflicts, reduce threats and retire the bomb. The evening will feature a pre-program reception and bring together experts in the field, including General James E. Cartwright, former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former commander of the US nuclear forces who has a unique insider view into the threats posed by a nuclear arsenal; Reza Aslan, the bestselling author of Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth and No God But God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam; and Barbara Slavin, a Ploughshares Fund grantee, author, journalist and Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council and noted expert in Middle East issues.\n&quot;In periods of heightened tensions and reduced decision times, the likelihood of human and technical error in control systems increases,&quot; said General James E. Cartwright, former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. &quot;Launch-on-warning is a relic of Cold War strategy whose risk today far exceeds its value. Our leaders urgently need to talk and, we hope, agree to scrap this obsolete protocol before a devastating error occurs.&quot; &quot;The historic agreement reached with Iran could potentially, for the first time, put that country&#39;s nuclear program in an iron box with a camera on it,&quot; said Joe Cirincione, President of Ploughshares Fund. &quot;We are delighted to bring our guest speakers together in a discussion that explores the broader context of these issues and why it is so important to seize this opportunity with Iran.&quot;\nIn addition, the evening will feature a special interactive pop-up exhibit from N Square. The special one-night-only exhibit explores how 21st-century innovation can accelerate progress toward the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. A new initiative sponsored by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, Ploughshares Fund, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and Skoll Global Threats Fund, N Square was created to catalyze innovation that moves the world toward disarmament while improving global safety and security in the meantime.\nSince 1981, Ploughshares Fund has led and invested in initiatives to reduce and ultimately eliminate the world&#39;s nuclear threats and to promote stability in regions of conflict."], ["end_time", "2015-06-08 21:00:00.000000"], ["free", "f"], ["image", "../img/stock_imgs/fundraisers2.jpg"], ["name", "Ploughshares Fund Chain Reaction 2015"], ["start_time", "2015-06-08 18:00:00.000000"], ["updated_at", "2015-06-24 00:30:25.269755"], ["venue", "Futures without Violence�۪s Open Square Conference Center in the Presidio"]]

By learning how to calm the mind and reconnect with our true nature we can discover the happiness that lies within us and that is, in fact, the very essence of who we are.\n\nIn this evening class, local Bay Area meditation master Orgyen Chowang Rinpoche will provide instructions on Mindfulness meditation as well as on how to go beyond mindfulness to journey deep into our Pristine Mind and experience unconditional happiness through Pristine Mind meditation.\n\nThe session will include instructions and guided meditation to familiarize us with techniques we can use to help untie the knots of thoughts, emotions, distraction, stress, and anxiety that create discomfort in our minds and conflict in our lives.\n\nBy mastering these techniques, we can stabilize a feeling of satisfaction, delight, and security, have the strength and power to deal with whatever challenges we face, and delight in the joys of our life not through insatiable need, but as majestic extensions of our true state of mind.\n\nBeginners welcome. No previous background with meditation is required.\n\nOrgyen Chowang Rinpoche is a meditation master in the Nyingma lineage of the Buddhist tradition. He studied for ten years at Larung Gar in Serta, eastern Tibet, with his teacher, Jigmed Phuntsok Rinpoche, who is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest Dzogchen meditation masters of the twentieth century.
